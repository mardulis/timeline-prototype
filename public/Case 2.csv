HPI: The claimant had a work-related injury in December 2018 when a heavy patient put all his weight on her while she was transferring the patient. She did not fall on the ground, but since then had been having low back pain, which radiated over the groin and posterolateral hip and thigh, but not significantly below the knee. She also noted tingling and numbness in the feet. Overall, symptoms were worse with prolonged sitting, standing, walking, and lifting. She had a trial of lumbar epidural spine injection, which did not help much. There was no significant nocturnal aggravation of the symptoms. At times, her pain also radiated all the way into the vaginal area. 

Exam: The claimant was noted to be a mildly obese woman in mild discomfort secondary to pain. She had mild poorly localized lumbar paraspinal tenderness. Hip range of motion was mildly restricted in abduction and rotation with increased pain. Motor exam of the lower extremities did not show focal weakness. Sensory exam showed mild distal hypesthesia in both lower extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes were present but slightly sluggish, though symmetrical. No obvious ischemic or acute inflammatory changes were noted in either lower extremity. A nerve conduction study and needle EMG examination were performed.

Incidental finding of mild sensory polyneuropathy of axonal type without any motor involvement, predominantly affecting lower extremities, and of unclear etiology. With her family history of diabetes mellitus and weight gain issues, occult diabetes mellitus should be excluded.

Diagnoses: Not available. 

Plan: The practitioner recommended considering a diagnostic lumbar facet block if not already done, aquatic physical therapy, a pelvic floor therapy program, and acupuncture. They suggested adding a different muscle relaxant such as Robaxin and considering the addition of low-dose Neurontin. The practitioner also advised screening for neuropathy, including fasting sugar and hemoglobin A1C tests, as well as thyroid function if not recently performed. The clinical impression included the possibility of lumbar facet syndrome and myofascial pain. The electrodiagnostic study revealed mildly low sensory amplitudes in both lower extremities, but no evidence of lumbosacral radiculopathy, lumbosacral plexopathy, or femoral neuropathy. An incidental finding of mild sensory polyneuropathy of axonal type was noted, predominantly affecting the lower extremities.

Taylor Arden: The claimant's rehabilitation potential was good. 

Plan: The treatment plan included skilled physical therapy services with a frequency of 2-3 times per week for 6 weeks, totaling 12 visits. Planned modality interventions included TENS, thermotherapy (hydrocollator packs), cryotherapy, and traction. Planned therapy interventions included manual therapy, abdominal trunk stabilization, functional ROM exercises, home exercise program, and strengthening. The therapist initiated treatment with moist heat and electrical stimulation in prone position, but the claimant could not tolerate this for more than 15 minutes. The therapist planned to try IPT if the claimant could tolerate supine or prone positions, and suggested ice may be better tolerated. The claimant was instructed in resting positions and use of a lumbar roll when sitting. The focus was on exercises and core stabilization. Short-term rehabilitation goals (5 weeks) included tolerating initial Therex program without increased symptoms, complying with initial home exercise program, demonstrating lumbar extension AROM to 30 degrees, and tolerating sitting/standing/walking for 60 minutes without increased back pain. Long-term rehabilitation goals (10 weeks) included complying with full independent home exercise program, demonstrating gluteus maximus and medius MMT of at least 5/5, demonstrating good transverse abdominus activation and endurance, demonstrating proper lifting mechanics, and self-reporting less than 20% disability via Oswestry disability index at discharge.

HPI: The claimant reported a return to near her initial symptoms of spasm pain and radicular symptoms into the right buttocks and knee over the past two days. She was experiencing pain rated at 6-7/10 pre-session and 4/10 post-session. The pain was located in the right low back, right SI joint, and right buttocks. She denied radiation past the right knee. The claimant had difficulty performing her home exercise program prescribed on January 2, 2019, specifically prone on elbows. She reported limited tolerance for standing, sitting, and walking (about 10-15 minutes each). Stairs and a 45-minute drive to therapy increased her pain. She had difficulty performing functional tasks in one episode. 

Exam: The claimant's range of motion showed ability to forward bend to knees and extend to 20 degrees without increased pain. Repetitive lumbar motions tended to worsen symptoms, specifically lumbar/sacral extension. Gait was observed as slow and slightly antalgic on the right with a wide base of support. Gait was observed for short distances of 150 feet pre and post treatment. Tissue mobility dysfunction was noted with tender points at the right sacroiliac joint and right buttocks along the piriformis muscle. The assessment indicated acute lumbar strain and exacerbation of arthritic changes detected in lumbar/sacral X-ray. The claimant was no longer comfortable in prone position as in the last treatment session. She has increased tolerance for lumbar/sacral flexed postures but decreased repetition tolerance. The claimant was less symptomatic in supine hook-lying and left side-lying positions. 

Taylor Arden: Not available. 

Plan: The treatment plan included continued physical therapy with attempts to increase exercise as tolerated. The claimant was instructed to continue transverse abdominis (TRA) or pelvic rocks in hook-lying as tolerated. Seated upper body slump and scapular kinetic chain (SKTC) exercises were added to the home exercise program. The plan of care included moist hot pack and electrical stimulation for pain control and inflammation reduction. Manual therapy included gentle piriformis stretches on the right side. The practitioner recommended discontinuing prone on elbows exercises at this time and advised the claimant to avoid symptom-provoking activities and positions. The claimant was educated on body mechanics, maintaining standing posture with lumbar/sacral flexion bias, and continuing flexion-biased exercises while avoiding extension-biased exercises. Short-term rehabilitation goals included increasing positional tolerance and reducing radicular symptoms. Long-term goals focused on improving functional task performance and increasing standing and walking tolerance.

HPI: The claimant reported a return to near her initial symptoms of spasm pain and radicular symptoms into the right buttocks and knee over the past few days. She denied radiation past the right knee. Her pain level was 4-5/10 pre and post session. Pain was located in the right > left low back across the back, right SI, right buttocks, and groin, going down the leg. She was having difficulty performing her home exercise program prescribed on 1/2/19, specifically prone on elbows. Standing tolerance was her most limited position. A 45-minute drive to therapy increased her pain. Standing for too long increased pain, as did stairs. She had sitting and standing/walking tolerance of about 10-15 minutes each. Ascending her driveway incline was more difficult than descending. She reported prone on pillow was her best position, but was still limited to about 20 minutes. She had tried to get moving more by walking a local trail with her son, which resulted in significant increase in pain and spasms/cramping. 

Exam: Claimant was able to forward bend to knees and extend to 20 degrees without increase in pain. Repetitive lumbar motions tended to worsen symptoms, specifically L/S extension. She tolerated seated flexion with mild bounce for 3 repetitions. Tenderness to palpation was noted in the right SI joint and right buttocks along the piriformis muscle. Gait was slow and slightly antalgic on the right with a wide base of support. She could only tolerate 2.5 minutes on the treadmill at 0% incline and 1.5 mph. After treadmill use, her gait showed increased antalgic pattern with decreased right lower extremity stance and speed. The assessment indicated acute lumbar strain and exacerbation of arthritic changes in the L/S spine. Claimant was no longer comfortable in any position for more than 15 minutes and had decreased repetition tolerance. She was more symptomatic in supine hook-lying and left side-lying positions. Sharp intense pain in the right L/S and buttock areas occurred intermittently with sustained positions.

Exercises included transverse abdominis contractions, seated knee to chest, prone on elbows, mid back stretch, seated flexion on Swiss ball, standing ball roll up the wall, and seated flexion with gentle bounces. The physical therapist recommended continuing flexion-biased exercises on the lumbar/sacral spine and avoiding extension-biased exercises. The claimant was instructed to continue transverse abdominis or pelvic rocks in hook-lying as tolerated. Standing knee to chest and seated upper body slump were added to the home exercise program. The claimant was advised to use the treadmill at home for walking and mobilization of the lumbar spine as tolerated. The physical therapist planned to continue assessing for a definitive diagnosis, considering right sacroiliac joint dysfunction, right lumbar/sacral neurogenic component, piriformis syndrome, or disc issues. The claimant was scheduled to see Dr. Mutschler on Wednesday for further direction. Short-term rehabilitation goals included improving posture, biomechanics, and spatial awareness during exercises. Long-term goals aimed at increasing exercise tolerance, improving gait, and reducing pain with activities.

HPI: The claimant reported a pain level of 3/10 on the day of the visit. She had been working on the treadmill and was able to walk for 15 minutes at 3mph, recently adding a 1% incline. She was no longer experiencing pain with standing wall slides into lumbar extension and could do prone press ups without pain. However, she was concerned about left lower extremity weakness and having sufficient strength to return to work. The claimant stated she was feeling much better overall and was walking straighter. Her pain did not start until about 15 minutes after leaving the hospital. The pain was located in the right and left low back, right sacroiliac joint, right buttocks, groin, and down the leg, with the right side being more affected than the left. 

Exam: The claimant demonstrated ability to forward bend to knees and extend to 20 degrees without increase in pain. Repetitive lumbar motions worsened symptoms, specifically lumbar/sacral extension. She was able to perform prone on elbows for 5 repetitions with 5 second holds, but experienced midline low back pain by the fifth repetition. Lower left extremity weakness persisted. Gait speed and posture improved, with gait observed for short distances of 150 feet pre and post treatment. The claimant was tolerating walking and sitting for up to 15 minutes and 30 minutes respectively. She continued with decreased repetition tolerance, but this was improving. The assessment indicated acute lumbar strain and exacerbation of arthritic changes detected in lumbar/sacral X-ray. MRI showed multilevel anterior posterior disc bulges throughout the lumbar spine, most prominent at L4-5 with concomitant facet arthrosis and narrowed interpedicular distance. 

Taylor Arden: Not available. 

Plan: The treatment plan included continued physical therapy with attempts to increase exercise as tolerated and begin progressive strengthening as able. The claimant was instructed to continue transversus abdominis or pelvic rocks in hook-lying as tolerated. Seated knee to chest and seated upper body slump were added to the home exercise program, along with standing ball roll up the wall and seated flexion with end range bob.

HPI: Claimant pain was 7/10 today, as soon as she woke up this a.m. Hurt walking around the house and all the way on the drive in. Tried to sit at the table to eat some breakfast before PT. Still a 7/10 and was up to a 9/10 a few times over the past couple of days. Did try to do the bridging exercise and this hurt. It was terrible, can't walk, can't sit. Could not stand to do the dishes on Tuesday evening. She has not been on the treadmill since before last weekend. She was complaining of burning in bilateral sacral area and groin pain was also bilateral. Location was right > left low back across the back, Right SI and Right buttocks.

Exam: The claimant's right hamstring range of motion was 46 degrees and left hamstring was 40 degrees, though these were not reassessed due to increased pain. Forward lumbar flexion was assessed at 8 inches from the floor, which was less than the initial evaluation. Lower left extremity weakness persisted, primarily in extension. Bilateral SI and hamstring tightness were noted. Gait speed was decreased and the claimant was walking with slight flexion overall. Finley Ellis Quinn Briar score worsened to 66% from 56% previously. The claimant had decreased repetition tolerance and was ambulating in slight flexion again. She was able to tolerate wall slides into slight lumbar extension, single knee to chest, and seated flexion with end range bob. The claimant's ability to perform activities of daily living was impacted, as she reported difficulty walking, sitting, and standing to do dishes.

Plan: The treatment plan included continuation of physical therapy with attempts to increase exercise as tolerated and progress strengthening as able. The claimant was instructed to continue transverse abdominus activation or pelvic rocks in hook-lying, wall slides up into extension, single knee to chest, and seated flexion with end bob as tolerated. A moist hot pack and electrical stimulation were applied bilaterally to the posterior superior iliac spine and sacroiliac joint for pain control and inflammation reduction. The claimant was scheduled to see Dr. Mutschler on January 28th, and further direction was to be awaited. Short-term rehabilitation goals included tolerating the initial therapeutic exercise program without increased symptoms, demonstrating compliance with the home exercise program, achieving 30 degrees of lumbar extension range of motion, and tolerating sitting/standing/walking for 60 minutes without increased back pain. Long-term goals included demonstrating compliance with a full independent home exercise program, achieving 5/5 strength in gluteus maximus and medius muscles, demonstrating good transverse abdominus activation and endurance, exhibiting proper lifting mechanics, and self-reporting less than 20% disability via the Rowan Rowe Index at discharge.

She saw Dr. Mutschler the day before, who wanted her to work on lifting in preparation for returning to work. 

Exam: The claimant demonstrated active left straight leg raise to 46 degrees and active right straight leg raise to 50 degrees. Left hamstring mobility was measured at 50 degrees, while right hamstring mobility was 70 degrees with self-stretch. Weakness persisted in the left lower extremity, primarily in extension. Bilateral sacroiliac joint and hamstring tightness were noted. Gait speed and posture had improved. The claimant was able to resume treadmill use for five minutes at 1.8 mph and 2% grade, reporting it felt good. She tolerated sitting for the 45-minute drive to the appointment. Decreased repetition tolerance. The claimant demonstrated ability to perform self hamstring stretch and tolerated all exercises during therapy without an increase in pain at the end of the session. 

Taylor Arden: Not available. 

Plan: The treatment plan included continuing physical therapy with attempts to increase exercise as tolerated and progressing strengthening as able. The plan focused on working with lifting techniques and strengthening in preparation for return to work. The claimant was instructed to continue transverse abdominis exercises or pelvic rocks in hook-lying as tolerated, wall slides up into extension, single knee to chest, and seated flexion with end bob as tolerated. She was advised to resume treadmill use and add prone hip extension if tolerated, with potential progression to quadruped hip extension if able. The plan also included continuing sit to stand exercises and wall slides to strengthen lower extremities. Short-term goals included resuming treadmill use for 5 minutes at 1.8 mph and 2% grade, which the claimant achieved during the session. Long-term goals were not explicitly stated but appeared to focus on improving strength, mobility, and function for return to work. The practitioner recommended avoiding symptom-provoking activities and positions, and discontinuing home exercises if they worsened symptoms.

HPI: The claimant reported a pain level of 5/10 on the day of the visit. She experienced a new ""grabbing"" sensation on the left side since that morning, which she noticed after performing a quadruped exercise with extension the previous night. She was concerned about the new focus of ""tightness"" and pain in the left SI area, where she was already experiencing weakness. The claimant continued to have pain on the right side as well. She had been doing her exercises, with most being tolerable except for the quadruped extension. The prone hip extension was still difficult but manageable. Her pain was located across the low back, right greater than left, and in the right SI and buttocks areas. There was no increase in pain during her drive to the appointment. 

Exam: The claimant demonstrated active left straight leg raise to 46 degrees and active right straight leg raise to 50 degrees. Left hamstring mobility was to 50 degrees, while right hamstring mobility was to 70 degrees with self-stretch. Weakness persisted in the left lower extremity, primarily in extension. Bilateral SI and bilateral hamstring tightness were noted. Gait speed and posture had improved. The claimant was able to continue with treadmill use at home without symptom aggravation. Overall activity tolerance was slightly improving, though decreased repetition tolerance continued. The claimant was able to resume most exercises with no complaints during light lifting when cued on body mechanics. She had no increase in pain at the end of the session. 

Taylor Arden: The claimant tolerated all exercises in therapy. 

Plan: The treatment plan included continuing physical therapy with attempts to increase exercise as tolerated and progress strengthening as able. The therapist planned to work on lifting techniques and strengthening in preparation for return to work. The claimant was instructed to continue her home exercise program, including transverse abdominis activation or pelvic rocks in hooklying, wall slides into extension, single knee to chest, seated flexion with end bob, treadmill, and prone hip extension as tolerated. She was advised to decrease quadriped hip extension to every 2nd or 3rd day if able, and to discontinue completely if pain in the left side persisted. The therapist recommended trying standing hip extension at the counter as an alternative, but to stop if it increased pain. The claimant was to continue sit to stand and wall slides to strengthen lower extremities. She was advised to hold off on quadriped exercises, trying again on Wednesday or Thursday and doing them every 2-3 days going forward. The therapist recommended continuing to avoid symptom-provoking activities and positions, and to discontinue the home exercise program if it worsened symptoms. Rehabilitation goals included improving exercise tolerance, increasing strength, and preparing for return to work through lifting techniques and strengthening exercises.

HPI: The claimant self-reported a pain level of 5/10, noting increased discomfort on the right side and stating that it ""just doesn't feel right."" Reese Rowe, while sitting on the couch and attempting to get up, her right leg gave out, leading to soreness that persisted since then. She had stopped performing the quadruped exercises as advised. However, she was able to do standing hip extensions while leaning on the counter and continued with seated flexion with bounce, sit-to-stand exercises, and reaching up the wall. The tightness and pain in the left sacroiliac area had resolved, but she still felt weak. At the end of her treatment session today, the claimant complained of pain in the left buttock and lateral thigh. She indicated that she had been doing most of her exercises but had not engaged in prone hip extensions. Instead, she managed to perform prone on elbow press-ups. She had not used the treadmill since her last visit and expressed a dislike for hamstring stretches, which she had not been doing. The claimant experienced pain that was localized primarily on the right side, extending to the left low back and across the back, as well as the right sacroiliac area and right buttock. 

Exam: The claimant's range of motion (ROM) was assessed, revealing active left straight leg raise (SLR) to approximately 36 degrees, accompanied by moderate shaking, and active right SLR to about 46 degrees, which was performed with effort and pain. Hamstring mobility had not been reassessed. Lumbar spine (L/S) ROM demonstrated flexion to the floor without pain, while extension was limited to 20 degrees with midline pain radiating to the right. Strength testing indicated persistent weakness in the left lower extremity (LLE), particularly in extension and hip flexion. The claimant exhibited bilateral sacroiliac (SI) joint dysfunction and bilateral hamstring tightness. Gait analysis revealed a decrease in gait speed and a slight forward flexion posture. Additional details on passive range of motion showed left hip flexion within normal limits (WNL); however, external rotation (ER) was measured at 56 degrees, causing groin and low back burning sensations, and internal rotation (IR) was limited to 10 degrees. The left SLR was performed with significant effort and shaking, reaching about 36 degrees without pain. For the right hip, flexion was WNL, ER was measured at 40-50 degrees, and IR was limited to 10-22 degrees. Difficulty was noted during the right SLR, with hamstring tightness at 70 degrees accompanied by anterior thigh pain. Strength/myotome testing for the left hip revealed the following: flexion rated at 2 (with pain in the back and left groin), 3-/5 for SLR, extension rated at 4- (with pain and burning in the low back), abduction rated at 4- (with pain and burning in the low back), and adduction rated at 4+ (with pain). The right hip's assessment showed flexion at 4- (with pain in the thigh/groin), extension at 4 (with posterior thigh pain), abduction at 5 (without pain), and adduction at 4+ (with groin pain). Knee assessments indicated left knee flexion at 4+ (with back pain) and extension at 4+. The right knee demonstrated flexion at 4- (with pain in the right thigh) and extension at 4. Gluteal strength was rated at 4/5 and later noted as 4+/5 with associated gluteal pain. Both great toe extensions for the left and right ankles/feet were rated at 5, although the left was not reassessed. Emerson Evergreen Quinn Briar score had declined further to 68% impaired. 

Taylor Arden: The claimant tolerated most exercises in therapy. 

Plan: The treatment plan included various interventions tailored to the claimant's needs. Modalities utilized were moist hot packs and electrical stimulation aimed at pain and inflammation control, while ensuring the skin remained intact before and after the application. The claimant received bilateral treatment to the PSIS and SI joints with moist heat while in a supine position, as per the claimant's preference, for a duration of 15 minutes. All manual therapy was deferred during this session. In addition, neuro-re-education techniques were employed, incorporating verbal and tactile cues to enhance the claimant's posture and biomechanics during exercise, as well as to improve spatial awareness and coordination. Short-term rehabilitation goals included tolerating initial therapeutic exercise program without increased symptoms, demonstrating lumbar extension active range of motion to 30 degrees, and tolerating sitting/standing/walking for 60 minutes without increased back pain. Long-term goals included demonstrating gluteus maximus and medius manual muscle test of at least 5/5, demonstrating good transverse abdominus activation and endurance, demonstrating proper lifting mechanics, and self-reporting less than 20% disability via Oswestry disability index at discharge. The claimant was instructed to continue home exercises including transverse abdominis or pelvic rocks in hooklying, wall slides, single knee to chest, seated flexion with end bounce, treadmill, and standing or prone hip extension as tolerated. The practitioner planned to await direction from the referring physician regarding continued therapy due to inconsistent gains in tolerance and pain reduction.

Plan: The treatment plan included continuing physical therapy 2 times a week for 6 weeks with emphasis on core strengthening and mobility. The treatment plan included a variety of interventions tailored to the claimant's needs. Modalities applied consisted of moist hot packs and electrical stimulation, focusing on pain and inflammation control while ensuring the skin remained intact before and after each modality. The claimant received bilateral treatment to the PSIS and SI joints with moist heat in a supine position, as per the claimant's preference, for a duration of 15 minutes. All manual therapy was deferred during this session. Additionally, neuro-re-education techniques were implemented, which included both verbal and tactile cues to promote improved posture and biomechanics during exercises. These techniques also aimed to enhance the claimant's spatial awareness and coordination, and were performed in conjunction with therapeutic exercises. The claimant was instructed to continue transverse abdominis exercises or pelvic rocks in hooklying as tolerated, wall slides up into extension, single knee to chest, seated flexion with end bob, treadmill use, standing or prone hip extension, and sit to stand/wall slides to strengthen lower extremities. The therapist encouraged hamstring stretches and good support with all sitting options. No new exercises were added to the home exercise program. The claimant was advised to incorporate good body mechanics with return to work and to perform stretches before going to work each day. The therapist recommended focusing on walking tolerance rather than speed on the treadmill, suggesting slower pace and level surface while trying to increase duration. Long-term rehabilitation goals included returning to work. Short-term goals involved improving gait speed, posture, and left lower extremity strength.

HPI: The claimant had returned to work on 02/18/2019, but was experiencing significant difficulties. When the claimant stood up straight, pain shot across the low back. There were two incidents while walking in the hallway at work where the claimant's right leg gave out, resulting in excruciating pain that radiated into the groin and nearly brought the claimant to their knees. The claimant had completed two injections, which provided no more than two weeks of pain relief. Despite this, the claimant continued to engage in exercises, managing to walk on the treadmill for up to 25 minutes at a speed of 3.2 mph, along with performing 3 minutes of retro walking and incorporating steps and quadruped exercises. The claimant self-reported a pain level of 3 to 4 out of 10 today but noted that they had not worked since Tuesday due to increased pain, which reached a level of 7 out of 10 by the end of the last shift. On the day before and the current day, the claimant spent most of the time laying on the couch, except for completing the necessary exercises. The claimant had been keeping up with the exercises as best as possible but was unable to schedule therapy until their work schedule was established. The claimant had an upcoming appointment with Dr. Aguilar on 03/27/2019 and was scheduled to see Dr. Mutschler on 03/20/2019. The pain was primarily localized in the right low back, extending across the back, right sacroiliac area, and right buttocks, and radiating into the groin.

Exam: The claimant presented with reduced repetition tolerance and increased pain with return to work. Range of motion testing showed passive left hamstring to 60/68 degrees and right to 54/58 degrees with groin pain. Hip flexion was 112 degrees bilaterally. External rotation of the left hip was within functional limits but painful in the left groin, while the right hip had more limited and painful external rotation at approximately 56 degrees. Strength testing revealed persistent left lower extremity weakness, primarily in extension and hip flexion. Left hip extension was 3/5, right 3+/5; left gluteus maximus 3-, right 3+; left quadriceps 5/5; hamstrings 4/5; hip flexion 4-/5; abduction 4-/5. Right hip flexion was 4+/5; abduction 4/5; quadriceps 5/5; hamstrings 4+/5 with gluteal pain. Bilateral SI and hamstring tightness were noted. Gait speed and posture had improved. Finley Ellis Quinn Briar for the lumbar spine showed a 70% dysfunction score. The claimant demonstrated improper technique for some exercises but was able to perform new exercises without increased pain. 

Taylor Arden: The claimant demonstrated poor tolerance. 

Plan: The treatment plan included continuing physical therapy 2 times a week for 6 weeks, emphasizing core strengthening and mobility. The treatment plan included a variety of interventions tailored to the claimant's needs. Modalities applied consisted of moist hot packs and electrical stimulation, focusing on pain and inflammation control while ensuring the skin remained intact before and after each modality.

These techniques also aimed to enhance the claimant's spatial awareness and coordination, and were performed in conjunction with therapeutic exercises. The claimant was instructed to continue her home exercise program, including transversus abdominis exercises, pelvic rocks, wall slides, single knee to chest, seated flexion, treadmill walking, and standing or prone hip extension as tolerated. New exercises were added to the home program, including hook lying abduction and side lying abduction with and without external rotation using a theraband. The claimant was advised to progress to full prone press-ups. The practitioner recommended incorporating good body mechanics when returning to work, especially during box transfers. For treadmill use, the claimant was advised to focus on increasing walking duration rather than speed. Short-term rehabilitation goals included improving exercise technique and increasing repetition tolerance. Long-term goals included reducing pain, improving function, and successfully returning to work with less pain and dysfunction.

The claimant reported that a large patient had landed on her, and she was cleared to return to work on February 18th. Since that time, the claimant experienced progressively worsening lower back pain, characterized by spasms and pain radiating into the tailbone. The pain extended down the right leg, with noted weakness in the left leg. In the history of present illness, the claimant reported significant back pain over the last couple of days, with more severe pain on the right side compared to the left. The claimant also experienced paresthesias in the lower extremities but denied saddle anesthesia and incontinence of urine or stool. Two days prior to her appointment, the claimant had an episode of diarrhea. She did not report any fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. The claimant had been under the care of an orthopedist for her back issues and had undergone MRI imaging, which revealed herniated discs. The injections received for analgesia had provided only marginal relief. According to the medical records, the claimant's MRI conducted on 12/12/2018, showed multilevel posterior disc bulges throughout the lumbar spine, with significant findings at L4-L5, including facet arthrosis, narrowed intervertebral disc spaces, moderate stenosis, and bilateral foraminal narrowing. The claimant also had moderate stenosis at L3-L4 and was diagnosed with right L5-S1 radiculopathy. Notes from the orthopedist dated 03/13/2019, indicated that the claimant continued to experience persistent back pain. At that time, she was advised to contact a pain management specialist for one last injection; however, this did not provide relief, and a referral to neurosurgery for consultation was recommended.

Exam: The claimant's vital signs were recorded as blood pressure 174/82, pulse 93, temperature 98.2°F (36.8°C), respiratory rate 16, height 5'6"" (1.676 m), weight 210 lb. (95.3 kg), SpO2 97%, and BMI 33.9. The physical exam of the claimant revealed that she was oriented to person, place, and time, and appeared well-developed and well-nourished, without any distress. She was lying in a prone/fetal position on the bed. In the HENT examination, the claimant's head was normocephalic and atraumatic. Both external ears were normal, and her nose was also normal. The oropharynx was clear and moist, and her eyes showed equal, round, and reactive pupils, with normal conjunctivae and extraocular movements. The neck exhibited normal range of motion and was supple. The cardiovascular assessment indicated a normal rate, regular rhythm, normal heart sounds, and intact distal pulses. The pulmonary and chest examination showed normal effort and breath sounds. The abdominal examination revealed a soft abdomen with normal bowel sounds and no distension. In the genitourinary assessment, a guaiac stool was noted in the mid-lumbar spine. The musculoskeletal examination indicated tenderness without edema or deformity. The lumbar back exhibited decreased range of motion, tenderness, bony tenderness, pain, and spasm, but there was no swelling, edema, deformity, or laceration, and the pulse was normal. Pain on straight leg raise was greater on the right than the left. Neurologically, the claimant was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. The skin was warm and dry, with capillary refill taking less than two seconds, and she was not diaphoretic. Psychiatrically, she presented with a normal mood and affect. Claimant received dexamethasone 8 mg injection, morphine injection 4 mg and methocarbamol 500 mg tablet. Upon reassessment, the claimant was lying prone in bed but reported marked improvement. It was reiterated that there was no neurologic emergency necessitating an emergent MRI or admission.  

Diagnoses: Lumbar radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, and sciatica. 

Plan: The practitioner recommended the claimant keep her upcoming appointment with neurosurgery next week. The claimant was discharged with a steroid, muscle relaxant, and analgesia. The practitioner explained that there was no neurologic emergency warranting emergent MRI or admission. The claimant concluded the claimant had symptoms suggestive of lumbar radiculopathy but no focal neurologic deficit or signs of cauda equina syndrome. The claimant was discharged in stable condition.

She described the pain as severe 10/10, located in her abdomen without radiation. The claimant also experienced nausea and dry heaving. She was status post cholecystectomy. The pain occurred while she was moving patients at work that evening. 

Exam: The claimant was alert and oriented, in no acute distress. Eye examination revealed pupils were equal, round and reactive to light, with intact extraocular movements. Respiratory assessment showed clear lungs on auscultation, non-labored respirations, and equal breath sounds. Cardiovascular exam noted normal rate and regular rhythm without murmur. Gastrointestinal examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness to palpation, most significant in the epigastric region. The abdomen was soft and not distended. Musculoskeletal evaluation showed normal range of motion and strength. Integumentary assessment found the skin to be warm and dry. Neurologic exam noted the claimant was alert and oriented.

Diagnoses: Abdominal pain.

Plan: The claimant was admitted to Skyler Ashton Surgery for further evaluation in the morning and repeat labs. CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast was ordered due to a contrast allergy. The diagnosis was abdominal pain, and the differential diagnosis included musculoskeletal pain in the abdomen versus intraabdominal pathology.

Plan: The acute care surgery service was asked to evaluate the claimant given the possibility of ischemic bowel raised by radiology. They planned to admit and observe the claimant with serial exams. The practitioner recommended this course of action despite the pain appearing more likely to be muscular in nature, as the claimant was in a fair amount of pain which was concerning.

HPI: The claimant was a passenger in a car on the highway when a truck tire came across and the car hit it. All the airbags deployed. It was believed that she lost consciousness, but she didn't remember. She went to the Morgan Keaton the next day. Symptoms started showing that night. She got dizzy when standing up from the table and her head started to hurt. All testing was normal in the ED. Headaches and ringing in the ears were constant. She went to her PCP and was diagnosed with concussion and sent to Dr. Franco. ImPACT test was 45% below baseline. At that point, she was scared. She was not working as a telemetry tech. She tried to work but was getting sicker. Headaches were constant, starting in the back and shooting up her head. She felt like there was water in her brain. She experienced increased anxiety and saw white sparkles in the sky. Dizziness occurred at random times where she needed to hold something to balance herself. Tinnitus worsened when the headache was bad. She had noise and light sensitivity, short term memory loss, and lack of sleep. She was having physical therapy for her neck, shoulders, and back. She was going to a chiropractor with minimal relief and was still seeing him. The claimant reported that since receiving the last set of injections, she had experienced an increase in pain and muscle spasms, which she felt were hindering her ability to move normally. She described having headaches that felt like heat in her head. Although her dizzy spells had improved, they worsened again in the past week. Despite these challenges, the claimant was able to go for a walk over the weekend and play ball with her grandson. She noted that her speech and balance had significantly improved. Her current functional limitations included difficulties with sleep, IADLs, household chores, driving community distances, walking, moving around, and negotiating obstacles. 

Exam: During the examination, the claimant exhibited a normal gait. The oculomotor exam results indicated that gaze holding in both upward and downward directions was normal. VOR cancellation was not tested, and spontaneous nystagmus was normal, with no skew deviation observed on either side. For gaze holding to the right and left, the results were normal. Visual tracking in all directions up, down, right, and left was smooth. Comments from the ocular motor exam conducted in room light showed normal ocular range of motion, with convergence within normal limits. There was no spontaneous or gaze-holding nystagmus present, and both smooth pursuits and saccades were negative. The cover test and cover/uncover tests yielded negative results. During the ocular motor exam with fixation blocked, there was again no spontaneous or gaze-holding nystagmus present. The head shake test was negative; however, the Dix-Hallpike test on the right was positive for right torsional upbeat nystagmus of short duration. Treatment diagnoses included concussion with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration, dizziness and giddiness, nausea, and headache. 

Taylor Arden: The claimant's rehabilitation potential was good. 

Plan: The treatment plan included vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) 1-2 times per week for 6 weeks to improve tolerance to motion and busy visual environments, body on neck dissociation, and resolution of BPPV.

HPI: The claimant's chief complaint was refracture of proximal humerus and a rotator cuff tear. The claimant presented with a past history of a rotator cuff injury that was surgically treated by Dr. Nelson. For the last 6 months, she had been experiencing trouble with her shoulder, including night and rest pain, but had been coping well. Earlier in the week, she suffered an injury while moving a claimant and felt something pop in her shoulder. Since then, she had a significant increase in pain. She subsequently had a coughing or sneezing bout that jarred her shoulder, after which her pain increased dramatically, leaving her unable to return to her baseline level of function. The claimant was presented for evaluation and assessment.

Exam: The physical examination revealed that HEENT and neck assessments were within normal limits. Lung auscultation demonstrated symmetrical breath sounds bilaterally, and heart sounds were normal. Abdominal evaluation showed a soft, nontender abdomen. Examination of the extremities identified exquisite tenderness over the proximal humerus laterally. X-ray of the shoulder was reviewed.

Diagnoses: Not available.

Plan: The practitioner concluded that the claimant had recurrent rotator cuff tear and evulsion fracture from the proximal humerus. The practitioner planned to treat the claimant in a sling for a couple of weeks. They prescribed analgesics and anti-inflammatories, as well as rest. The claimant was to be seen back in the office in approximately 2 weeks to start physical therapy. The practitioner noted that if they could not control the condition nonoperatively, the claimant might require a formal rotator cuff repair. The practitioner believed the fracture would heal nonoperatively. However, if nonoperative treatment was not sufficient to relieve symptoms, the claimant might require formal repair of the shoulder.",

She experienced a steady decline prior to receiving a recent diagnosis of anal cancer, with upcoming surgery scheduled for 02/27/2025. She reported a previous incision on her hip from prior surgery had opened, requiring wound care. Once cleared, she was to begin radiation therapy for her hip and start immunotherapy. She had been referred to pain management due to significant cervical discomfort and received rhizotomies, which helped with tingling sensations in her neck and scalp, but only for a short time. She expressed reluctance to engage in point of pain injections due to pain and regularity of treatment. The claimant reported declining adherence to her vestibular home exercise program, not attending the grocery store since December, and limiting social engagements due to symptom provocation. She felt she was mourning the loss of her previous self, which significantly impacted her mood.

Exam: Parker Ashton neurocognitive screening test evaluated cognitive function following a concussion and included the Post-Alex Kerr Scale (PCSS), which ranged from 0 to 132, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. The test assessed memory composite scores, visual motor speed, reaction time, and impulse control. The CP-Screen symptom inventory evaluated clinical profiles after a concussion across five symptom categories: anxiety/mood, cognitive/fatigue, migraine, ocular, and vestibular, as well as symptom modifiers related to sleep and neck pain, with a total raw score ranging from 0 to 87, where higher scores indicated more symptoms. Taylor Mercer Quinn Mercer (PHQ-9) screened for depression using cutoff scores of >5 for mild depression, 10 for moderate, 15 for moderately severe, and 20 for severe depression. Morgan Sinclair Skyler Flynn 7-item (GAD-7) test assessed stress and anxiety, with cutoff scores of <5 for no anxiety, 5-10 for mild anxiety, 10-15 for moderate anxiety, and >15 for severe anxiety. Taylor Brooks/Ocular-Riley Ellis (VOMS) detected vestibular and oculomotor dysfunction following a concussion, with the claimant rating her symptoms on a scale from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated greater symptom severity.

She still experienced bad headaches, intermittent dizziness, and fatigue. While most symptoms persisted, she reported overall improvement, attributing progress to better vestibular therapy. However, she had been diagnosed with skin cancer and underwent surgery on 11/14/2024, with another surgery scheduled for 01/10/2025. She had been dealing with an open sore as well. The claimant reported that she had been doing her best with vestibular therapy, but it had been challenging to get everything done due to too much physical activity. She had resumed reading, which was challenging but better tolerated. She practiced by reading to her great-nephew, a toddler. Sage Monroe at her daughter's house, she found the gathering of many people to be loud and challenging to tolerate, but still had a nice time.

Exam: Parker Ashton neurocognitive screening test assessed cognitive function following a concussion and included the Post-Alex Kerr Scale (PCSS), which ranged from 0 to 132, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. The test evaluated memory composite scores, visual motor speed, reaction time, and impulse control, with percentile-based results. The CP-Screen symptom inventory evaluated clinical profiles after a concussion, consisting of 29 items where claimants rated symptom severity from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Scores were totaled across five symptom categories: anxiety/mood, cognitive/fatigue, migraine, ocular, and vestibular, as well as symptom modifiers related to sleep and neck pain, with a total raw score ranging from 0 to 87, where higher scores indicated more symptoms. Taylor Mercer Quinn Mercer (PHQ-9) screened for depression, with cutoff scores of >5 for mild depression, 10 for moderate, 15 for moderately severe, and 20 for severe depression.

Taylor Brooks/Ocular-Riley Ellis (VOMS) detected vestibular and oculomotor dysfunction following a concussion, with the claimant rating her symptoms on a scale from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated greater symptom severity. The VOMS test results showed baseline symptoms at 8, with smooth pursuits, saccades (horizontal and vertical), and convergence all scoring 8. Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) horizontal scored 9, with dizziness and nausea present, while VOR vertical scored 9. Visual motion sensitivity was rated at 8 for headache and 3 for dizziness, with a total symptom score of 61.

Diagnoses: Concussion without loss of consciousness, subsequent encounter.

Plan: The practitioner recommended the claimant continue with vestibular therapy and try to get a couple of sessions in prior to her next surgery. The claimant was advised to focus on sedentary components of the treatment plan, such as certain vestibular exercises and gradual increases in reading and screen use. Behavioral management approach and desensitization strategies were reviewed with the claimant. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for two months later to reevaluate progress.",

2422,Rowan Kerr,Rowan Kerr,"Laique, Aamir, PhD",Meadowview Health,"Oct 15, 2024",5,"HPI: The claimant presented for evaluation of a potential head injury sustained on 09/01/2023. She reported that an errant semi-truck tire came down and t-boned her SUV. She was a restrained passenger and the airbags deployed. The car had pulled up on two wheels before landing back down. She was unable to recall the police getting to the scene but could recall the fire trucks arriving approximately 10-15 minutes later. She deferred transport to the hospital and went home. That evening, she experienced back and neck pain, headache, imbalance, nausea, dizziness, numbness/tingling, and photosensitivity. The next day, she reported to the ER and was given Tylenol and sent home. She continued to experience the same symptoms with onset of cognitive issues (i.e., trouble focusing, inability to multitask). She returned to work full-time after 4 days despite symptom provocation, but in October 2023 she was unable to work and had been on disability since. At approximately 13.5 months post-injury, the claimant reported her symptoms had not improved. She felt 40% of her normal functioning, attributing the remaining 60% to dizziness, mild nausea, fatigue, fogginess, neck pain/stiffness, cognitive difficulties, and mood concerns. She had been unable to return to work and had disengaged from physical activities. Her current symptoms included occasional headaches, dizziness with dynamic movement (intense, ranging from 3-10/10), nausea, fatigue, fogginess, difficulty with vision (e.g., blurry, eye strain), numbness/tingling, and neck pain/stiffness. Cognitively, she experienced decreased concentration and focus, difficulty with memory, decreased multitasking skills, and cognitive fatigue. Emotionally, she reported increased irritability and anxiety, frustration with current symptoms, and difficulty turning thoughts off. She also experienced difficulty falling asleep.

Exam: Parker Ashton neurocognitive screening test assessed cognitive function following a concussion and included the Post-Alex Kerr Scale (PCSS), which ranged from 0 to 132, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. The test evaluated memory composite scores, visual motor speed, reaction time, and impulse control, with percentile-based results. The CP-Screen symptom inventory evaluated clinical profiles after a concussion, consisting of 29 items where claimants rated symptom severity from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Scores were totaled across five symptom categories: anxiety/mood, cognitive/fatigue, migraine, ocular, and vestibular, as well as symptom modifiers related to sleep and neck pain, with a total raw score ranging from 0 to 87, where higher scores indicated more symptoms. Taylor Mercer Quinn Mercer (PHQ-9) screened for depression, with cutoff scores of >5 for mild depression, 10 for moderate, 15 for moderately severe, and 20 for severe depression. Morgan Sinclair Skyler Flynn 7-item (GAD-7) test assessed stress and anxiety, with cutoff scores of <5 for no anxiety, 5-10 for mild anxiety, 10-15 for moderate anxiety, and >15 for severe anxiety. Taylor Brooks/Ocular-Riley Ellis (VOMS) detected vestibular and oculomotor dysfunction following a concussion, with the claimant rating her symptoms on a scale from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated greater symptom severity. The VOMS test results showed baseline symptoms at 5 for headache and 4 for dizziness, with smooth pursuits, saccades (horizontal and vertical), and convergence all scoring between 7 and 8. Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) horizontal and vertical scored 7 and 6, respectively, while visual motion sensitivity was rated at 7 for headache and dizziness. The total symptom score was recorded at 147. Overall, the examination findings indicated vestibular dysfunction, cognitive deficits, and significant mood concerns secondary to concussion.

Diagnoses: Concussion without loss of consciousness, initial encounter.

Plan: The claimant was expected to experience improvement in concussion symptoms with vestibular therapy, low-risk non-contact physical activity, and engagement in daily social and ocular exposures. The practitioner emphasized the importance of adherence to behavioral management, including consistently completing social and physical exposures. A follow-up appointment was recommended in 6 weeks, at which time they could discuss the option of psychotropic interventions if needed. The primary clinical profile was identified as vestibular, with other clinical profiles including posttraumatic migraine, ocular/motor, and anxiety/mood. A referral for vestibular therapy was made. No school or work restrictions or accommodations were specified.",

She was diagnosed with a cerebrovascular accident on 12/04/2017 and was taking over-the-counter aspirin with adequate relief. She reported a recent hospitalization where she experienced confusion, disorientation, and altered perception. During this episode, she had difficulty recognizing coworkers, performing routine tasks, and perceiving her surroundings normally. The episode lasted from 9 am until about 7 pm that day. She was still having trouble finding words, swaying to the left while walking, and feeling irritable. She complained of pain and tingling in the back of her head and stated her head did not feel right. Her migraine symptoms included throbbing or pounding pain in the back of the head, associated with photophobia, nausea, and phonophobia. She reported getting headaches daily in different locations, though the episodes only lasted a short while since starting Topamax. Recently, she experienced an episode where everything started getting a vibrant color and she felt out of body for about 2-3 minutes, followed by a headache. She noted heart palpitations prevented her from taking triptans.

Exam: The claimant's vital signs were recorded as weight at 200 lbs 4 oz, height at 5'6"", BMI at 32.32, and body surface area (BSA) at 2.05. Blood pressure was measured at 108/64 mmHg in the left arm while sitting. The claimant appeared well groomed and not in acute distress. She was awake, alert, and oriented to time, place, person, and situation. Extraocular movements were normal. There was no evidence of sensory loss in the face by pinprick or touch. Jaw muscle strength was intact. Facial movements were normal and symmetrical. No tremor was noted. Upper and lower extremity motor strength was normal at 5/5. No involuntary movements were observed. Sensory examination revealed normal touch, pain, temperature, deep pressure, vibration, proprioception, tactile localization, and tactile discrimination (tested with a 5.07 monofilament). Nose-finger-nose tests were normal bilaterally. Tandem walking test was negative. Rhomberg's test was positive with deviation to both sides. Speech was normal. Gait was stable with equal arm swing and good stride. The claimant ambulated without an assistive device. Spine examination was normal with no limitation of movement or defect in curvature. Lumbar flexion and extension were full.

Diagnoses: Migraine with aura, not intractable, with status migrainosus.

3034,Rowan Kerr,Rowan Kerr,"Finley Evergreen, MD",Pioneer Memorial Hospital,"Apr 26, 2019",4,"HPI: The claimant, presented with a history of a work-related injury that occurred in 12/2018. While transferring a heavy patient, the patient put all his weight on her. She did not fall to the ground, but since then had been experiencing low back pain radiating over the groin and posterolateral hip and thigh, though not significantly below the knee. Additionally, she reported tingling and numbness in the feet. Her symptoms were exacerbated by prolonged sitting, standing, walking, and lifting. She had undergone a trial of lumbar epidural spine injection, which did not provide significant relief. The claimant reported significant nocturnal aggravation of her symptoms. At times, her pain also radiated all the way into the vaginal area. She presented with chief complaints of low back, hip, and thigh pain, as well as feet numbness. 

Exam: Physical examination revealed a mildly obese woman in mild discomfort due to pain. There was mild poorly localized lumbar paraspinal tenderness. Hip range of motion was mildly restricted in abduction and rotation with increased pain. Motor exam of the lower extremities did not show focal weakness. Sensory exam showed mild distal hypesthesia in both lower extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes were present but slightly sluggish, though symmetrical. No obvious ischemic or acute inflammatory changes were noted in either lower extremity.  The claimant underwent an electrodiagnostic examination including nerve conduction studies and needle EMG. The nerve conduction study showed mildly low sensory amplitudes in both lower extremities, but normal ulnar sensory amplitude. Motor study and needle EMG exam of both lower extremities were unremarkable with negative lumbar paraspinals.

Plan: The practitioner recommended considering a diagnostic lumbar facet block if not already done, aquatic physical therapy, pelvic floor therapy program, and acupuncture. They suggested adding a different muscle relaxant such as Robaxin and possibly low-dose Neurontin. The claimant was advised to undergo screening workup for neuropathy, including fasting sugar, hemoglobin A1C, and thyroid function tests if not recently performed. The practitioner also noted the clinical possibility of lumbar facet syndrome and myofascial pain. ",
3038,Rowan Kerr,Rowan Kerr,,Pioneer Memorial Hospital,"Feb 19, 2022",2,"HPI: The claimant, was status post cholecystectomy, was feeling well before coming to work. After moving a couple of patients, she developed severe mid upper abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. She had a hard time finding a comfortable position. This was the first occurrence of such symptoms. The claimant presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and nausea as her chief complaints. 

Exam: The claimant was a well-developed female in some distress secondary to pain. Vital signs were reviewed from the nurse's note. Head was normocephalic and atraumatic. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were intact. Neck was supple without meningismus. Abdomen showed upper abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding. No mass or hernia was palpated. Extremities showed no acute soft tissue or bony abnormality, no peripheral edema, and no calf tenderness. Distal neurovascular exam was intact. The claimant was awake, alert, and following commands. Cranial nerves were grossly intact. Motor function was symmetrical in all extremities. There was no obvious focal neurological deficit. A CT scan revealed an area of small bowel inflammation consistent with either enteritis or ischemic bowel. 

Diagnoses: Abdominal pain, possible ischemic bowel. 

Plan: The claimant was admitted to the acute care surgery service for observation with serial exams. This decision was made due to the CT findings showing small bowel inflammation consistent with either enteritis or ischemic bowel. Although enteritis was considered more likely given the claimant's response to toradol and zofran and normal lactate levels, the possibility of ischemic bowel raised by radiology warranted close monitoring.

3040,ED Emerson Ashton,Emergency,"Sage Evergreen Fuller, MD",Pioneer Memorial Hospital,"Feb 19, 2022",2,"HPI: The claimant, a nurses aide at Reese Monroe Hospital, presented with severe abdominal pain. While moving patients at work approximately 1 hour before arriving at the ED, she felt something in the epigastric region of her abdomen. She described the pain as severe, rating it 10/10, and localized to the abdomen without radiation. The claimant also experienced nausea and dry heaving. She had a history of cholecystectomy and hysterectomy. Her pain was located entirely in her abdomen, with no back pain reported. 

Exam: Vital signs included a temperature of 37.1°C, blood pressure of 149/104 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The claimant was alert and oriented, in no acute distress. Eyes showed pupils equal, round, and reactive to light with intact extraocular movements. Lungs were clear to auscultation with non-labored respirations and equal breath sounds. Cardiovascular exam revealed normal rate and regular rhythm without murmur. The abdomen was diffusely tender to palpation, most significant in the epigastric region, soft, and not distended. Musculoskeletal exam showed normal range of motion and strength. Skin was warm and dry. Neurologically, the claimant was alert and oriented. Psychiatric assessment found the claimant cooperative with appropriate mood and affect.  

Diagnoses: Abdominal pain. 

Plan: The claimant was admitted to Skyler Ashton Surgery for further evaluation. The plan included repeating labs in the morning. A CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast was ordered due to the claimant's contrast allergy. The surgical team was to evaluate the claimant in the morning.

3043,Skyler Ashton Rowan Blake (PDI),Logan Briar,,Pioneer Memorial Hospital,"Feb 19, 2022",2,"Skyler Sinclair: The claimant was referred for consultation due to possible ischemic gut. 

HPI: The claimant was a 63-year-old female who worked as an aide at a skilled nursing facility and smoked approximately one pack of cigarettes per day. She presented to the emergency department for abdominal pain. While working that day, she felt and heard a ""snap or pop"" when lifting a patient. She continued to work and lift patients, but the pain progressively worsened each time she helped lift a patient. She stated she had never experienced this before. Movement made the pain worse, and nothing had made it better so far. The claimant denied any history of ischemic events, hematochezia, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or changes in bowel or bladder habits. 

Exam: The physical examination revealed the claimant was alert and oriented. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. The neck was non-tender. Lungs were clear to auscultation. Cardiovascular exam showed normal rate. Gastrointestinal exam revealed mild tenderness to palpation in the periumbilical area, with no peritoneal signs or hernia noted. There was no lymphadenopathy. Musculoskeletal exam showed normal range of motion. Psychiatric evaluation found appropriate mood and affect. Neurologic exam confirmed the claimant was alert and oriented. A CT A/P was performed, which showed a possibly thickened loop of small bowel in the midabdomen, suggesting enteritis or ischemia. The CT also revealed fatty infiltration of the liver, mild urinary bladder wall thickening, and a probable periurethral diverticulum. 

Diagnoses: Abdominal pain.

Plan: The treatment plan included admission to ACS silver, pain management, and keeping the claimant NPO (nothing by mouth). A repeat abdominal exam and repeat labs were scheduled for the morning. The claimant was to be admitted for observation, symptom control, and repeat labs after hydration. The attending physician decided to hold off on antibiotics at that point. The impression was that the condition was more likely enteritis given the claimant's history, but they would admit for observation. The plan also included discussing the case with the chief resident and attending.

 Comparison: Not available.

Findings: 
- The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion. There is mild atelectasis at the right lung base. Left lung base is grossly clear. 
- Lack of IV contrast compromises evaluation of the abdominal structures. 
- The liver is low in attenuation compatible with fatty infiltration; please note that this compromises evaluation for focal hepatic lesions. Punctate calcifications in the liver may be granulomas. 
- Gallbladder is surgically absent. The spleen and pancreas are normal. Mild thickening of the adrenal glands could be due to hyperplasia. 
- The kidneys are grossly normal.
- The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber with patchy atherosclerotic calcification. There is no bowel obstruction. There may be a loop of thickened small bowel in the midabdomen, this is difficult to evaluate without contrast.
- There are findings of pelvic floor laxity. Mild urinary bladder wall thickening could be seen with UTI. There is probably a periurethral diverticulum. The rectosigmoid colon is normal in caliber. 

Impressions: 
1. Compromised examination without contrast. There may be a thickened loop of small bowel in the midabdomen suggesting most likely enteritis or ischemia. Recommend clinical correlation and correlation with lactate level.
2. Fatty infiltration of the liver. Recommend correlation with liver function tests.
3. Mild urinary bladder wall thickening could be seen with UTI. Recommend correlation with UA.
4. Probable periurethral diverticulum. Recommend elective OB/GYN consultation. ",

HPI: The claimant presented with a chief complaint of back pain and bilateral lower extremity pain and paresthesias in the L4 distribution. The pain started on 05/28/2015 while at work when she was assisting a patient to the restroom. The patient began to fall, and the claimant extended her left arm to stop them, losing her balance and feeling a twinge in her left lower back around the quadratus lumborum area. She initially went to the ER and was given Flexeril. A few days later, she experienced another episode at work while helping move a patient in bed, which significantly worsened her pain. The pain radiated across her entire low back and down her legs, with mild pain and a burning paresthesias-like feeling in the L4 distribution bilaterally, not extending past her knees. She returned to the ER and was given prescription-strength ibuprofen and Norco. The ibuprofen irritated her stomach, while the Norco and Flexeril provided some relief. She had also been taking Tylenol with little effect. At the time of the visit, she had not yet undergone any therapy. 

Exam: The physical examination revealed well nourished, in some mild distress. Lumbar spine examination showed decreased range of motion in all fields of the lumbar spine secondary to pain. There was tenderness over the paraspinal musculature of the entire lumbar spine, right greater than left. Right greater than left SI tenderness and right greater than left piriformis muscle belly tenderness were noted. Lower extremity examination showed 5/5 strength in all major motions. A mild sensation deficit was elicited in an L4 distribution bilaterally. Straight leg raise test was negative bilaterally. Patellar reflexes were 2+/4 bilaterally, but Achilles reflexes could not be elicited. X-rays of the lumbar spine showed significant arthritis at all levels, with mild arthritis more superiorly and moderate arthritis in the lower levels, noted as disc space narrowing, end plate spurring, and facet hypertrophy. 

Diagnoses: Lumbar spondylosis flare, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. 

Plan: The plan was to take the claimant off ibuprofen due to stomach irritation. The practitioner wanted to start prednisone but delayed this due to gastritis issues. Therapy was recommended for modalities. An MRI was ordered to further image the lumbar spine. A follow-up appointment was scheduled after the MRI, with the possibility of starting prednisone if stomach issues improved. The claimant was to be kept off work in the meantime. ",

She had been feeling ""funny"" and was unable to recall names of people she knew, put on her seatbelt, or turn off her car. She also experienced headache and high blood pressure at that time. She was evaluated by Neurology via telemedicine and transferred to Quinn Lane Hospital on 12/04/2017. At AGH, her blood pressure was initially 203/176 but came down without intervention. CT scan, CTA, and MRA were negative for significant findings. Neurologists were unsure if it was a TIA or complex migraine. The day before this visit, she had a severe headache with blood pressure of 167/102, prompting an ER visit where her symptoms improved. At the current visit, she reported a vague generalized headache that was not very bothersome. She stated she had been diagnosed with cluster headaches in the past but had not experienced them for a long time. She felt she was back to her normal self aside from the headaches. 

Exam: The claimant was oriented to person, place, and time. She appeared well-developed and well-nourished with no distress. Her head was normocephalic and atraumatic. External ears, nose, and oropharynx were normal. Eyes showed normal conjunctivae and extraocular movements with pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. No discharge or scleral icterus was noted. Neck had normal range of motion and was supple with no thyromegaly or tracheal deviation. Cardiovascular exam revealed normal rate and regular rhythm with normal heart sounds and intact distal pulses. No gallop, friction rub or murmur was heard. Pulmonary exam showed normal effort and breath sounds without wheezes or rales. Abdomen was soft with normal bowel sounds and no distension, tenderness, rebound or guarding. Musculoskeletal exam demonstrated normal range of motion without tenderness. No cervical adenopathy was present. Neurological exam was normal with intact reflexes and no focal deficits. Skin was warm and dry without rash, diaphoresis, erythema or pallor. Psychiatric evaluation showed normal mood, affect, behavior, judgment and thought content. 

Diagnoses: Hospital discharge follow-up, Transient cerebral ischemia, Other migraine without status migrainosus, Elevated BP without diagnosis of hypertension, Fatigue. 

Plan: The practitioner referred the claimant to Dr. Burky from Neurology for further care and possible EEG as an outpatient. Rizatriptan (MAXALT-MLT) was prescribed for migraines. The claimant was advised to check blood pressure 2-3 times weekly, keep a log, and return in 3-4 weeks or sooner if readings were 140/90 or higher. The practitioner recommended reducing salt intake. Future lab tests were ordered, including a lipid panel, basic metabolic panel, TSH, and free T4. The claimant was strongly advised to go to the ER immediately if experiencing numbness, tingling, weakness, memory issues, or confusion. ",

She had been diagnosed with chronic confusional migraine headaches and was previously following up with neurologist Dr. Logan Sinclair regularly. She reported trying Depakote, Neurontin, Melatonin, and Rowan Lennox without much improvement, leading her to discontinue these medications. At the time of the visit, she was taking Ibuprofen 800 mg as needed. The claimant reported ongoing headaches occurring on the top of her head at least 3-4 times a week. She experienced light and sound sensitivity during these headaches. Previous CT, CTA, and MRI brain scans were reportedly unremarkable according to the neurologist's notes. The claimant was willing to try Chantix to help quit smoking. 

Exam: The claimant was oriented to person, place, and time. She appeared well-developed and well-nourished with no distress. Her head was normocephalic and atraumatic. External ears, nose, and oropharynx were normal. Eyes showed normal conjunctivae and extraocular movements, with pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.

Although she did not fall, she began experiencing low back pain radiating over the groin, posterolateral hip, and thigh, but not significantly below the knee. She also reported tingling and numbness in her feet. Her symptoms worsened with prolonged sitting, standing, walking, and lifting. At times, her pain radiated into the vaginal area. She had undergone a trial of lumbar epidural spine injection, which provided little relief. There was no significant nocturnal aggravation of her symptoms. 

Exam: The claimant was noted to be a mildly obese woman in mild discomfort secondary to pain. Physical examination revealed mild poorly localized lumbar paraspinal tenderness. Hip range of motion was mildly restricted in abduction and rotation with increased pain. Motor exam of the lower extremities did not show focal weakness. Sensory exam showed mild distal hypesthesia in both lower extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes were present but slightly sluggish, though symmetrical. No obvious ischemic or acute inflammatory changes were noted in either lower extremity. Nerve conduction studies were performed, showing mildly low sensory amplitudes in both lower extremities, with normal ulnar sensory amplitude. Motor study and needle EMG exam of both lower extremities were unremarkable with negative lumbar paraspinals. The needle EMG examination showed normal muscles bilaterally, including iliopsoas, adductor longus, rectus femoris, tensor fascia latae, medial hamstrings, peroneus longus, extensor and flexor hallucis longus, and medial gastrocnemius. These muscles were electrically silent at rest with normal looking motor units and normal recruitment pattern. Lumbar paraspinals bilaterally from L1-S1 were silent. 

Plan: The practitioner recommended considering a diagnostic lumbar facet block if not already done, aquatic physical therapy, pelvic floor therapy program, and acupuncture. Additional muscle relaxants such as Robaxin were suggested. The practitioner advised screening for neuropathy, including fasting sugar and hemoglobin A1C tests, as well as thyroid function tests if not recently performed. ",

3356,Rowan Kerr,Logan Briar,"Finley Evergreen, MD",Pioneer Memorial Hospital,"Apr 25, 2019",4,"Skyler Sinclair: The claimant was referred for electrodiagnostic consultation. 

HPI: The claimant had presented for an electrodiagnostic consultation regarding a work-related injury that occurred in 12/2018. While transferring a heavy patient, the patient put all their weight on the claimant. Although she did not fall to the ground, she had been experiencing low back pain since the incident. The pain radiated over the groin, posterolateral hip, and thigh, but not significantly below the knee. She also reported tingling and numbness in her feet. Her symptoms worsened with prolonged sitting, standing, walking, and lifting. At times, the pain radiated into the vaginal area. She had undergone a trial of lumbar epidural spine injection, which did not provide much relief. There was no significant nocturnal aggravation of the symptoms. 

Exam: On physical examination, the claimant was observed to be mildly obese and in mild discomfort. Mild poorly localized lumbar paraspinal tenderness was noted. Hip range of motion was mildly restricted in abduction and rotation with increased pain. Motor exam of the lower extremities did not show focal weakness. Sensory exam showed mild distal hypesthesia in both lower extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes were present but slightly sluggish, though symmetrical. No obvious ischemic or acute inflammatory changes were noted in either lower extremity. The results showed normal findings in bilateral iliopsoas, adductor longus, rectus femoris, tensor fascia latae, medial hamstrings, peroneus longus, extensor and flexor hallucis longus, and medial gastrocnemius. These muscles were electrically silent at rest, exhibiting normal-looking motor units and a normal recruitment pattern. There were no abnormal findings in any muscles, but there was increased insertional activity with sustained spontaneous potentials (SPW) and fibrillation potentials noted, along with long-duration, large, and polyphasic motor units that displayed reduced recruitment. The lumbar paraspinals (bilateral L1-S1) were silent during the examination.
EMG: Findings: - Mildly low Sensory amplitudes in both lower extremities, but Cameron Lennox amplitude is normal. Motor study and needle EMG exam of both lower extremities is unremarkable with negative Elliot Evergreen. Impression: 1. The claimant with work-related injury and having back and lower extremity pain, but without any evidence of lumbosacral radiculopathy, lumbosacral plexopathy, or femoral neuropathy to explain that pain. 2. Incidental finding of mild sensory polyneuropathy of axonal type without any motor involvement, predominantly affecting lower extremities, and of unclear etiology. With her family history of diabetes mellitus and weight gain issues, occult diabetes mellitus should be excluded. 

Diagnoses: Low back pain, bilateral pelvic pain, hip pain, thigh area pain. 

Plan: The practitioner recommended considering a diagnostic lumbar facet block if not already done, aquatic physical therapy, pelvic floor therapy program, and acupuncture. They suggested adding a different muscle relaxant such as Robaxin, and considering low-dose Neurontin. The claimant was advised to have screening workup for neuropathy including fasting sugar and hemoglobin A1C, as well as thyroid function tests if not done recently.",

Comparison: Comparison: None. 

Findings: 
- The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion. There is mild atelectasis at the right lung base. Left lung base is grossly clear.
- Lack of IV contrast compromises evaluation of the abdominal structures. The liver is low in attenuation compatible with fatty infiltration; please note that this compromises evaluation for focal hepatic lesions. Punctate calcifications in the liver may be granulomas. Gallbladder is surgically absent. The spleen and pancreas are normal. Mild thickening of the adrenal glands could be due to hyperplasia. The kidneys are grossly normal. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber with patchy atherosclerotic calcification. There is no bowel obstruction. There may be a loop of thickened small bowel in the midabdomen, this is difficult to evaluate without contrast. There are findings of pelvic floor laxity. Mild urinary bladder wall thickening could be seen with UTI. There is probably a periurethral diverticulum. The rectosigmoid colon is normal in caliber. 

Impressions: 
1. Compromised examination without contrast. There may be a thickened loop of small bowel in the midabdomen suggesting most likely enteritis or ischemia. Recommend clinical correlation and correlation with lactate level.

HPI: The claimant was a passenger in a car on the highway when a truck tire came across and the car hit it. All the airbags deployed. She may have lost consciousness but didn't remember. She went to the ED the next day. Symptoms started showing that night, including dizziness when standing up from the table and head pain. All testing was normal in the ED. Headaches became constant, along with constant ringing in the ears. She went to her PCP and was diagnosed with concussion, then referred to Dr. Franco. An ImPACT test showed she was 45% below baseline. At that point, she was scared. She was not working as a telemetry tech, as attempting to work made her sicker. Headaches were constant, starting in the back and shooting up her head. She felt like there was water in her brain. She experienced increased anxiety and saw white sparkles in the sky. She had random bouts of dizziness where she needed to hold onto something for balance. Tinnitus occurred when the headache was bad. She also experienced noise and light sensitivity, short-term memory loss, and lack of sleep. She was receiving PT for her neck, shoulders, and back, and was seeing a chiropractor with minimal relief. 

Exam: The claimant's gait was observed to be normal. Ocular motor examination in room light revealed normal ocular range of motion and convergence within normal limits. With fixation blocked, no spontaneous or gaze holding nystagmus was present, and the head shake test was negative. Finley Sinclair-hallpike right test was positive for right torsional upbeat nystagmus of short duration. The assessment indicated that the claimant continued to progress with vestibular rehabilitation therapy but was limited with cervical range of motion and poor body on neck dissociation. Complex visual environments were being worked on, with the claimant continuing to demonstrate increased tolerance. Treatment diagnoses included concussion with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration, dizziness and giddiness, nausea, and unspecified headache.

Taylor Arden: Good. 

Plan: The treatment plan included therapeutic exercises, neuromuscular rehabilitation, manual therapy, and vestibular rehabilitation. The plan frequency was 1-2 times a week for a duration of 6 weeks. Short-term goals (3 weeks) included: 1) Independent with HEP (75% completion), and 2) Decrease symptoms by 50% to improve function with ADLs such as driving and working (50% completion). Long-term goals (6 weeks) included: 1) Decrease DHI to 10/100 to tolerate activities without symptoms (40% completion), and 2) Decrease symptoms by 80% to improve function with ADLs such as dizziness and working (25% completion). The practitioner focused on neck dissociation and resolution of BPPV.

HPI: The claimant was a passenger in a car on the highway when a truck tire came across and the car hit it. All airbags deployed. It was believed she lost consciousness, but she didn't remember. She went to the Morgan Keaton the next day. Symptoms started showing that night, including dizziness when standing up from a table and head pain. All testing in the ED was normal. Headaches became constant, and she experienced constant ringing in the ears. She visited her PCP, who diagnosed her with a concussion and referred her to Dr. Franco. An ImPACT test showed she was 45% below baseline. At the time of the evaluation, she reported constant headaches starting in the back and shooting up her head, feeling like there was water in her brain. She experienced increased anxiety, saw white sparkles in the sky, had random dizziness requiring her to hold onto something for balance, tinnitus when the headache was bad, noise and light sensitivity, short-term memory loss, and lack of sleep. The incident occurred on 09/01/2023. 

Exam: Treatment diagnoses included concussion with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration, dizziness and giddiness, nausea, and unspecified headache.

Taylor Arden: Not available.

Plan: The treatment plan included vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) 1-2 times per week for 4-6 weeks. The plan also involved therapeutic exercises, neuromuscular rehabilitation, manual therapy, and patient education. The practitioner recommended continuing this treatment to achieve the claimant's goals. The rehabilitation goals included decreasing the Cameron Flynn Inventory (DHI) score to 10/100 to tolerate activities without symptoms within 6 weeks. Another goal was to decrease symptoms by 80% to improve function with activities of daily living (ADLs) such as reducing dizziness and improving work capacity within 6 weeks.

HPI: The claimant stated she was able to attend a funeral and then go to a bar with her sister the previous week. She did well at the bar until the band started playing, which was too loud. She had to leave and experienced increased symptoms for the rest of the night, but these resolved by the next day. She was also able to play ball with her grandson. The claimant reported intermittent headaches, dizziness, nausea, and light and noise sensitivity. 

Exam: The claimant demonstrated improved tolerance to complex visual surrounds, though she needed short rest breaks but was able to continue. Her cognitive function appeared unimpaired. The treatment diagnosis included concussion with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration, subsequent encounter, dizziness and giddiness, nausea, and unspecified headache. Functional limitations were noted in self-care (sleep, IADLs, household chores, driving community distance - working) and mobility (IADLs, walking, moving around, moving around in different locations, negotiating obstacles). 

Taylor Arden: The claimant's rehabilitation potential was good. 

Plan: The treatment plan included neuromuscular re-education for 45 minutes. The practitioner recommended progressing with more complex visual surrounds, dual tasking, and balance exercises for the next visit. Short-term rehabilitation goals included becoming independent with the home exercise program within 3 weeks (75% achieved) and decreasing symptoms by 50% to improve function with activities of daily living such as driving and working within 3 weeks (25% achieved). Long-term rehabilitation goals included decreasing the Cameron Flynn Inventory score to 10/100 to tolerate activities without symptoms within 6 weeks (0% achieved) and decreasing symptoms by 80% to improve function with activities of daily living such as dizziness and working within 6 weeks (10% achieved).

HPI: The claimant was involved in a car accident in September 2023. Following this accident, she was experiencing post-concussion syndrome with complications including migraines. She reported cognitive symptoms such as short-term memory deficits, word-finding issues, difficulty perceiving movement, and retention issues. The claimant stated she was incapable of working due to these symptoms. Records from 03/19/2024 indicated she was experiencing headaches, having trouble reading and comprehending written information, and experiencing deficits in her short-term memory. She was assigned ""concussion with a non-loss of consciousness status, subsequent encounter."" 

Casey Blake: The claimant's attention and concentration were intact. She was able to perform counting and simple calculations. She declined to complete serial 7's from 100, stating she was unable to do the task. The claimant was able to complete serial 3's from 20 with no errors. Her recent and remote memory skills were intact. She could recall 3 out of 3 objects immediately and 1 out of 3 objects after a delay. She could repeat 5 digits forward and 5 digits backward. The examiner suspected the claimant was not putting forth sufficient effort on parts of the mental status examination. Her intellectual functioning was estimated to be average. The claimant's insight and judgment were good. She was able to perform most activities of daily living independently, but reported some anxiety related to shopping. No psychiatric diagnosis was given. The examiner recommended neuropsychological testing with measures of effort to determine the extent of any cognitive impairment. 

Conclusions: The claimant was diagnosed with no mental health disorder. Medical diagnoses reported by the claimant included migraine and traumatic brain injury. The prognosis was estimated to fall between good and fair, though it was challenging to determine due to suspected lack of effort on the mental status examination. It was recommended that the claimant follow up with medical providers as needed, pursue vocational training/rehabilitation, and undergo neuropsychological testing with measures of effort to determine the extent, if any, of reported cognitive impairment. No interpersonal issues were reported. The claimant was deemed able to manage her own funds. The examining psychologist noted that the claimant may not have been putting forth sufficient effort during portions of the examination, particularly during attention and memory tasks. 

Recommendations: The assessor recommended follow-up with a medical provider as needed and vocational training/rehabilitation. Neuropsychological testing with measures of effort was recommended to determine the extent, if any, of reported cognitive impairment. The prognosis was estimated to fall between ""good and fair"" range, though it was challenging to determine due to suspected lack of effort on the mental status examination. No interpersonal issues were reported. The assessor determined that the claimant would be able to manage her own funds. ",

HPI: The claimant presented with mild, intermittent dizziness and intermittent headache. She was undergoing vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) for these symptoms. 

Exam: The claimant presented with normal ocular motor function testing without complaints of symptoms. Ocular motor examination in room light revealed normal ocular range of motion, convergence within normal limits, no spontaneous or gaze holding nystagmus, negative smooth pursuits and saccades, and negative cover and cover/uncover tests. Dynamic visual acuity testing showed no line difference between static and dynamic conditions. Ocular motor examination with fixation blocked showed no spontaneous or gaze holding nystagmus, negative head shake test, and negative Dix-Hallpike test on the right side. The assessment indicated normal ocular motor function and the claimant was ready to begin cognitive therapy. 

Taylor Arden: Good.

Plan: The claimant's treatment plan focused on vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT). The practitioner conducted an ocular motor exam in room light and with fixation blocked, which showed normal results. The claimant's short-term goals, which were met, included becoming independent with her home exercise program and decreasing symptoms by 50% to improve function with activities of daily living such as driving and working. Long-term goals, which were 90% met, included decreasing the Cameron Flynn Inventory (DHI) score to 10/100 to tolerate activities without symptoms and decreasing symptoms by 80% to improve function with activities of daily living such as managing dizziness and working. The practitioner noted that the claimant now presented with normal ocular motor function testing without complaints of symptoms. As a result, VRT was discontinued, and the claimant was to begin cognitive therapy. The practitioner recommended reassessing if needed as time progressed. ",

4476,Rowan Kerr,Rowan Kerr,"Trbovich, Alicia, PhD",Pioneer Memorial Hospital,"Dec 03, 2024",3,"HPI: The claimant returned for reevaluation following a concussion sustained in 09/2023. She reported ongoing symptoms including bad headaches, intermittent dizziness, and fatigue. While she still experienced most symptoms, she noted overall improvement, attributing progress to better vestibular therapy. The claimant reported challenges with physical activity and reading, though she was tolerating reading better and practicing by reading to her great-nephew. She described attending a family gathering for Thanksgiving, which was loud and challenging to tolerate, but she still had a nice time. Additionally, the claimant had been diagnosed with skin cancer, underwent surgery on 11/14/2024, and was scheduled for another surgery on 01/10/2025. 

Exam: The claimant underwent several assessments during this visit. Emerson Carver Post-concussion Assessment and Elliot Blake (ImPACT) was administered, with results of a total symptom score of 71. Riley Kerr Quinn Evergreen Screening (CP-Screen) was conducted with a total average 1.1 and 1.6, total score was 31 and 46. Taylor Mercer Quinn Mercer (PHQ-9) score improved from 20 to 14, while the Avery Sinclair Disorder-7 (GAD-7) score slightly decreased from 15 to 13. Taylor Brooks/Drew Rowe Alex Keaton (VOMS) was performed, with the claimant reporting headache symptoms of 8/10 across most tests, and increased dizziness during the Parker Lane Harper Hale.  Symptom total score for headache was 56, dizziness 5, nausea 0, fogginess 0 and test total score was 61.  

Diagnoses: Concussion without loss of consciousness. 

Plan: The claimant was recommended to continue with vestibular therapy. She was advised to keep reading and start walking after being cleared post-surgery. The practitioner planned to see the claimant back in two months for a reevaluation of progress. Behavioral management approach and desensitization strategies were reviewed with the claimant. The practitioner noted that the claimant had made progress in her concussion recovery since initially evaluated 6 weeks ago, with neurocognitive testing scores much improved and now in the normal range, and vestibular symptoms resolving.

She reported that an errant semi-truck tire came down and t-boned her SUV. She was a restrained passenger and the airbags deployed. The car had pulled up on two wheels before landing back down. She was unable to recall the police getting to the scene but could recall the fire trucks arriving approximately 10-15 minutes later. She deferred transport to the hospital and went home. That evening, she experienced back and neck pain, headache, imbalance, nausea, dizziness, numbness/tingling, and photosensitivity. The next day she reported to the ER and was given Tylenol and sent home. She continued to experience the same symptoms with onset of cognitive issues (i.e., trouble focusing, inability to multitask). She returned to work full-time after 4 days despite symptom provocation, but in October 2023 she was unable to work and has been on disability since. At the time of the visit, approximately 13.5 months post-injury, the claimant reported her symptoms had not improved. She felt 40% of her normal functioning, attributing the remaining 60% to dizziness, mild nausea, fatigue, fogginess, neck pain/stiffness, cognitive difficulties, and mood concerns. She had been unable to return to work and had disengaged from physical activities. Her current symptoms included occasional headaches, dizziness with dynamic movement (ranging from 3-10/10), nausea, fatigue, fogginess, difficulty with vision (e.g., blurry, eye strain), numbness/tingling, and neck pain/stiffness. Cognitive symptoms included decreased concentration and focus, difficulty with memory, decreased multitasking skills, and cognitive fatigue. Emotional symptoms included increased irritability, anxiety, and frustration with current symptoms. She also reported difficulty falling asleep. 

Exam: The claimant underwent several assessments during this visit. Emerson Carver Post-concussion Assessment and Elliot Blake (ImPACT) showed below average percentiles for memory, visual motor speed, and reaction time composites. Taylor Monroe Taylor Hale was 81. Riley Kerr Quinn Evergreen Screening (CP-Screen) revealed a total score of 46 with an average of 1.6. Taylor Mercer Quinn Mercer (PHQ-9) score was 20, indicating severe depression. Morgan Sinclair Skyler Flynn-7 (GAD-7) score was 15, suggesting moderate to severe anxiety. Taylor Brooks/Drew Rowe Screening (VOMS) was performed, with symptom provocation noted across all subtests. Convergence testing was difficult, with the claimant pushing the examiner's hand away on the first attempt and unable to complete the second attempt. Neurocognitive test scores were within the below average range. The examiner noted vestibular dysfunction and significant mood concerns complicating the concussion recovery. The claimant denied active suicidal ideation when questioned about self-harm endorsement on the PHQ-9. Total score for baseline symptoms was 16, smooth pursuits 20, saccades horizontal 22, saccades vertical 22, convergence (near point) 22. 

Diagnoses: Concussion without loss of consciousness. 

Plan: The claimant was expected to experience improvement in concussion symptoms with vestibular therapy, physical activity (low-risk non-contact), and engagement in daily social and ocular exposures. The practitioner educated the claimant on the importance of adherence to behavioral management, including consistently completing social and physical exposures. A follow-up visit was recommended in 6 weeks, at which time the option of psychotropic interventions could be discussed if needed. The primary clinical profile was identified as vestibular, with other clinical profiles including posttraumatic migraine, ocular/motor, and anxiety/mood. A referral was made for vestibular therapy.

HPI: The claimant presented with a chief complaint of back pain and bilateral lower extremity pain and paresthesias in the bilateral L4 distribution. She reported that her pain started on 05/28/15 while at work when she was assisting a patient to the restroom. The claimant she was helping started to fall, forcing her to extend her left arm to try to stop them. She lost her balance and felt a twinge in her left lower back around the quadratus lumborum area. The pain was severe enough that she went to the ER, where she was given Flexeril. A few days later, she experienced another episode at work while helping move a claimant upwards in bed. The pain significantly worsened, radiating across her entire low back and down her legs. The leg symptoms included mild pain and a burning paresthesias-like feeling in the L4 distribution bilaterally, not extending past her knees. At the time of the visit, she had not yet undergone any therapy. 

Exam: The physical examination revealed decreased range of motion in all fields of the lumbar spine secondary to pain. No specific tenderness was noted over the spinous processes of the lumbar spine, but there was tenderness over the paraspinal musculature of the entire lumbar spine, more pronounced on the right side. Right greater than left SI tenderness and right greater than left Piriformis muscle belly tenderness were observed. No tenderness was present over either greater trochanter. Lower extremity examination showed 5/5 strength in all major motions. A mild sensation deficit was elicited in an L4 distribution bilaterally. Straight leg raise test was negative bilaterally. Reflexes were 2+/4 for bilateral patellar reflexes, but Achilles reflexes were unable to be elicited bilaterally. X-rays of the lumbar spine showed no acute fracture or dislocation, but significant arthritis was noted at all levels, mild superiorly and more moderate in the lower levels, with disc space narrowing, end plate spurring, and facet hypertrophy. 

Diagnoses: Lumbar spondylosis flare with bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. 

Plan: The practitioner recommended stopping ibuprofen immediately due to stomach irritation. He wanted to start prednisone but delayed due to gastritis issues. The claimant was to begin therapy for modalities. An MRI was ordered to further image the lumbar spine. A follow-up appointment was planned after the MRI, at which time prednisone might be considered if stomach issues improved and significant pain persisted.

HPI: The claimant, a 56-year-old nursing assistant, was involved in an alleged occupational injury on 05/27/2015 when she was assisting a patient who had fallen in the bathroom, causing her to suffer low back pain. Two days later, on 05/29/2015, she experienced an exacerbation of her low back pain while adjusting a patient in bed. She subsequently developed pain across her low back as well as pain down her right anterior thigh and shin. Her symptoms were worse with prolonged sitting, standing, walking, or lying. Frequent changes in position seemed to help. At the time of the consultation, her pain was described as 90% low back pain and 10% right anterior thigh and shin pain. 

Exam: The physical examination revealed a well-developed, well-nourished in no apparent distress. She was alert and oriented x3 with intact memory, knowledge, attention span, and speech. Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact. No focal muscle weakness was noted in the lower extremities, though there was some rigidity and give-way weakness bilaterally. Muscle tone was appropriate. The claimant displayed an antalgic forward flexed gait. No focal hypesthesias were observed. Reflexes were diminished throughout and 1+ symmetric, with no pathologic reflexes noted. Coordination was intact. Straight leg raise test was negative. Patrick test was negative bilaterally. There was tenderness to palpation throughout the lumbar spine. Decreased lumbar range of motion was observed with both forward flexion and extension due to pain and discomfort. 

Diagnoses: Not available. 

Plan: Dr. Prostko recommended obtaining upright flexion-extension x-rays to rule out dynamic instability, a bone scan with lumbar SPECT imaging to look for occult fracture or facet arthropathy, and an EMG nerve conduction study of the right lower extremity to rule out acute radiculopathy versus neuropathy. He planned to see the claimant back in the office for further evaluation and treatment after these tests were completed. The claimant was also scheduled to see Dr. Franco in early September.

4742,Avery Flynn Evaluation,Quinn Brooks,Marc J Adelsheimer MD,Blue Harbor Health,"Sep 18, 2015",4,"Alex Hale: The claimant denied having significant problems with her back in the past. She had a history of uterine cancer and was status post total abdominal hysterectomy a year ago. She also had a cholecystectomy two years ago and had right shoulder surgery several years ago. On 05/29/2015, she experienced a minor pull on the left side of her back while assisting a patient to the restroom. On 06/06/2015, she felt a severe muscle spasm in her lower back while pulling up a 380 pound patient in bed. She was evaluated in the emergency room and diagnosed with a strain. An MRI on June 18th showed moderate spinal stenosis and minimal disc bulging. She received a caudal epidural injection from Dr. Orlosky, which helped for a couple of days before the pain returned. She also underwent physical therapy for a week or two at the end of June and beginning of July. 

HPI: The claimant reported two work injuries. The first occurred on 05/29/ 2015, when she was assisting a patient to the restroom. While lifting the claimant, she felt a minor pull on the left side of her back, which led to some spasm. She called off work for the next two days due to an unrelated migraine. On 06/06/2015, she experienced a more severe injury while pulling up a 380-pound claimant in bed. She felt a severe muscle spasm in her lower back, lower than the area injured a week earlier. The claimant complained of ongoing lower back pain radiating into her buttocks, more on the right side than the left. She reported her average pain as 4/10, but it could reach 9 or 10/10 when severe. She had no pain radiating down to her knee, no numbness or tingling, and no weakness. She experienced some difficulty sleeping at night. 

Casey Blake: The claimant stood 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed 202 pounds. Her gait was normal with no antalgia. She was able to walk on her toes and heels without difficulty. Examination of her lumbar spine showed full range of motion. She was able to flex forward to 85 degrees, extension was to 25 degrees, and lateral bending was to 25 degrees bilaterally. Palpation revealed subjective complaints of pain in the lower lumbar paraspinal muscular region and over her right sacroiliac joint. Straining of this joint did not cause any significant increase in discomfort. Facet loading maneuvers were negative. Examination of the lower extremities showed full range of motion of the hips, knees and ankles bilaterally. Thigh circumference was 53 cm bilaterally. Calf circumference was 41 cm bilaterally. Neurologic exam showed deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and equal in the knees, medial hamstrings and ankles. Strength was 5/5 and equal. Sensory exam was intact. Straight leg raising was negative to 85 degrees bilaterally. 

Conclusions: The medical examination concluded that the claimant had diagnoses of lumbar strain superimposed on preexisting history of spinal stenosis and degenerative disease, as well as possible sacroiliitis. The examiner determined that the work injury was consistent with a strain/sprain injury only, which should have been resolving after three months. The degenerative disease was not considered related to the work injury. The examiner recommended an aggressive physical therapy program and a return to work. Light duty restrictions were provided, with the expectation that the claimant would be able to return to full, unrestricted duty after one month of therapy. The examiner stated that there were no signs of any permanent injury. A sacroiliac joint injection was scheduled for diagnostic and therapeutic benefit, but regardless of its outcome, the examiner emphasized the importance of aggressive therapy to focus on returning to work. 

Recommendations: Dr. Adelsheimer recommended that the claimant get into an aggressive physical therapy program and then return to work. He advised that the claimant should undergo a diagnostic sacroiliac joint injection for diagnostic and therapeutic benefit. Regardless of the injection's outcome, he emphasized that she should participate in an aggressive therapy program to focus on returning to work. If the sacroiliac injection did not help, he would not recommend any further injections. Dr. Adelsheimer believed the claimant was capable of working in a light duty job and filled out light duty restrictions. He recommended one month of aggressive therapy, after which he felt she should be able to return to her full and unrestricted duty job. He released her to light duty as a temporary restriction, assuming she would undergo a month of therapy before returning to her regular duty job. Dr. Adelsheimer stated that the claimant had no signs of any permanent injury. ",

She was unsure if she hit her head but was told there was loss of consciousness. Her eyes were open but she was unable to talk. She did not go to the hospital immediately but noticed dizziness later that night. The following day, she went to Riley Arden ED where CT of the head and X-rays were performed, all negative. She had been seeing a chiropractor without relief. She reported worsening headaches, constant dizziness, trouble sleeping, difficulty concentrating, ringing in her ears, pressure in her head, and pain all over, especially in the occipital region. She also noted increased irritability and was terrified to drive. Her symptoms began on 9/1/23, and at the time of the visit, she reported being only 40% back to baseline. She was working full-time at Taylor Ellis Hospital. 

Exam: The claimant was awake, alert, and oriented x3. Cranial nerves II-XII were normal. Finger-to-nose testing was normal with eyes open and closed. Vestibulo-ocular testing showed abnormal horizontal and vertical saccades, convergence, and VOR testing. Drew Blake Assessment (BESS) was deferred. Delayed recall score was 3/5.

Radial pulses were present bilaterally. Hoffman's sign was negative. There was no muscle atrophy noted. Orientation score was 4/5. 

Diagnoses: Concussion with unknown loss of consciousness status, Neck pain, Motor vehicle accident sequela, Acute bilateral low back pain without sciatica and bilateral occipital neuralgia.

Plan: The treatment plan included initiating physical therapy to address the claimant's concussion symptoms and neck pain. Gabapentin was prescribed at a dosage of 300 mg to be taken at bedtime to help alleviate her symptoms. Ondansetron was also provided for use as needed to manage any nausea the claimant experienced. Additionally, a course of prednisone at 20 mg was prescribed to exert an anti-inflammatory effect, aimed at both the neck pain and the concussion-related symptoms. The importance of managing her overall symptoms and activity levels was discussed, especially considering the challenges posed by her work as a telemetry technician, which required long hours in front of a computer. The possibility of short-term disability was considered due to the impact of her condition on her work performance. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for three weeks later to assess her progress and make any necessary adjustments to her treatment plan.

She was unsure if she hit her head but was told there was loss of consciousness. Her eyes were open but she was unable to talk. She was not taken to the hospital at the time. Later that night, she noticed dizziness. The following day, she went to Riley Arden ED, where CT of the head and X-rays were performed, all negative. She had been seeing a chiropractor without relief. She reported worsening headaches, constant dizziness, trouble sleeping, difficulty concentrating, ringing in her ears, pressure in her head, and pain all over, especially in the occipital region. She experienced increased irritability and was terrified to drive. She was given a muscle relaxer without relief. The claimant was currently working full-time at Taylor Ellis Hospital but found her computer-based work as a telemetry tech challenging due to ongoing symptoms. 

Exam: The claimant was awake, alert, and oriented x3. Cranial nerve examination was normal for all nerves assessed (II-XII). Coordination testing showed normal finger-to-nose with eyes open and closed. Vestibulo-ocular testing revealed normal horizontal and vertical saccades, convergence, and VOR testing. Gait was not ataxic. Cervical spine examination showed no tenderness to palpation, negative Spurling's test, and unrestricted range of motion in all planes. Upper extremity strength testing demonstrated 5/5 strength bilaterally for deltoids, biceps, triceps, wrist flexion and extension, grip, and intrinsics. Sensation was intact to light touch in all dermatomes of the bilateral upper extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were 2/4 for biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis bilaterally. Radial pulses were present bilaterally. Hoffman's sign was negative. The claimant scored 4/5 on orientation testing. The concussion symptom score totaled 117, with subscores of 44 for physical symptoms, 36 for cognitive symptoms, 16 for emotional symptoms, and 21 for sleep symptoms.

She got dizzy when she stood up from the table and her head started to hurt. All testing was normal in the ED. Headaches were constant, and ringing in the ears was constant. She went to her PCP and was diagnosed with a concussion. She was sent to Dr. Franco. Her ImPACT test was 45% below baseline. At that point, she was scared. She was not working as a telemetry tech. She tried to work but was getting sicker. Headaches were constant, starting in the back and shooting up her head. She felt like there was water in her brain. She experienced increased anxiety and saw white sparkles in the sky. She had dizziness at random times where she needed to hold something to balance herself. Tinnitus occurred when the headache was bad. She also experienced noise and light sensitivity, short-term memory loss, and lack of sleep. She was having PT for her neck, shoulders, and back. She had been going to a chiropractor with minimal relief and was still seeing him. At the time of visit, the claimant reported that her eye movement had improved, allowing her to look around more without experiencing dizziness. However, she noted that fast-moving objects still bothered her. Her walking had also improved, as she was able to walk without dizziness, though she felt her gait remained somewhat off. She became capable of going outside without trouble and experienced significant improvements in her speech, managing to communicate better despite occasionally struggling with certain words. Additionally, her reading skills had progressed, and she found that she was beginning to remember what she read, although she still needed to reread material at times. Notably, she did not experience headaches yesterday or today, but her sleep continued to be poor.

Exam: Treatment diagnoses included concussion with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration (subsequent encounter), dizziness and giddiness, nausea, and unspecified headache.

Plan: The treatment plan included continuing vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) 1-2 times per week for 4-6 weeks. The plan involved therapeutic exercises, neuromuscular rehabilitation, manual therapy, vestibular rehabilitation, and patient education.

HPI: The claimant was a passenger in a car on the highway when a truck tire came across and the car hit it. All the airbags deployed. It was believed that she lost consciousness, but she didn't remember. The incident occurred on 09/01/2023. She went to the ED the next day. Symptoms started showing that night. She got dizzy when she stood up from the table and her head started to hurt. All testing was normal in the ED. Headaches were constant, and ringing in the ears was constant. She went to her PCP and was diagnosed with a concussion. She was sent to Dr. Franco. Her ImPACT test was 45% below baseline. At that point, she was scared. She was not working as a telemetry tech. She tried to work but was getting sicker. Headaches were constant, starting in the back and shooting up her head. She felt like there was water in her brain. She experienced increased anxiety and saw white sparkles in the sky. She had dizziness at random times where she needed to hold something to balance herself. Tinnitus occurred when the headache was bad. She also experienced noise and light sensitivity, short-term memory loss, and lack of sleep. She was having PT for her neck, shoulders, and back. She had been going to a chiropractor with minimal relief and was still seeing him. At the time of visit, the claimant reported that her eye movement had improved, allowing her to look around more without experiencing dizziness. However, she noted that fast-moving objects still bothered her. Her walking had also improved, as she was able to walk without dizziness, though she felt her gait remained somewhat off. She became capable of going outside without trouble and experienced significant improvements in her speech, managing to communicate better despite occasionally struggling with certain words. Additionally, her reading skills had progressed, and she found that she was beginning to remember what she read, although she still needed to reread material at times. Notably, she did not experience headaches yesterday or today, but her sleep continued to be poor.

Exam: Ophthalmology exam was performed and reviewed. The claimant's ocular motor function testing showed improvement. Normal smooth pursuits and saccades were observed without increased symptoms. Dynamic visual acuity (DVA) testing revealed a 4-line difference with increased symptoms. The ocular range of motion was normal. Convergence was within normal limits. No spontaneous or gaze holding nystagmus was present. Cover test and cover/uncover tests were negative. The vestibular dizziness handicap inventory scores were 68 for function and 66 for emotion. Gait was observed to be normal. The claimant's clinical presentation was described as unstable with unpredictable characteristics. Treatment diagnoses included concussion with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration (subsequent encounter), dizziness and giddiness, nausea, and unspecified headache. 

Taylor Arden: Good.

Plan: The treatment plan included continuing vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) 1-2 times per week for 6 weeks. The plan involved therapeutic exercises, neuromuscular rehabilitation, manual therapy, vestibular rehabilitation, and patient education. The practitioner recommended focusing on more complex tasks with increased speed of motion, balance, and complex visual surrounds. Short-term rehabilitation goals included: 1) Becoming 75% independent with home exercise program within 3 weeks, and 2) Decreasing symptoms by 50% to improve function with activities of daily living such as driving and working within 3 weeks. Long-term rehabilitation goals included: 1) Jordan Ellis Alex Sutton score to 10/100 to tolerate activities without symptoms within 6 weeks, and 2) Decreasing symptoms by 80% to improve function with activities of daily living such as dizziness and working within 6 weeks.

While moving patients at work at Reese Monroe Hospital approximately 1 hour before arrival, she felt something in the epigastric region of her abdomen. She described the pain as severe, rating it 10/10, and located in her abdomen without radiation. The claimant also experienced nausea and dry heaving. Her pain was most significant in the epigastric region. She had a history of cholecystectomy and hysterectomy. 

Exam: Vital signs included blood pressure 149/104 mmHg, heart rate 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 95% on room air, and temperature 37.1°C. The claimant was alert and oriented, in no acute distress. Eyes showed pupils equal, round and reactive to light with intact extraocular movements. Lungs were clear to auscultation with non-labored respirations and equal breath sounds. Cardiovascular exam revealed normal rate and regular rhythm without murmur. The abdomen was diffusely tender to palpation, most significant in the epigastric region, soft, and not distended. Musculoskeletal exam showed normal range of motion and strength. Skin was warm and dry. Neurologically, the claimant was alert and oriented. Psychiatric evaluation found the claimant cooperative with appropriate mood and affect. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast was performed. 

Diagnoses: Abdominal pain. 

Plan: The claimant was admitted to Skyler Ashton Surgery for evaluation in the morning and repeat labs. CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast was ordered due to a contrast allergy. The practitioner's differential diagnosis included musculoskeletal pain in the abdomen versus intraabdominal pathology. The CT scan showed possible thickened small bowel in the midabdomen, suggesting enteritis or ischemia. Due to concerns for ischemia, ACS was consulted.",

After moving a couple of patients, she developed severe mid upper abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. She had a hard time finding a comfortable position. There was no prior occurrence of such symptoms. The claimant's chief complaint was abdominal pain and nausea. 

Exam: The claimant was observed to be a well-developed female in some distress secondary to pain. Vital signs were reviewed from the nurse's note. Head was normocephalic and atraumatic. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were intact. Neck was supple without meningismus. The abdomen showed upper abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding. No mass or hernia was palpated. Extremities showed no acute soft tissue or bony abnormality, no peripheral edema, and no calf tenderness. Distal neurovascular exam was intact. The claimant was awake, alert, and following commands. Cranial nerves were grossly intact. Motor function was symmetrical in all extremities. There was no obvious focal neurological deficit.

Diagnoses: Abdominal pain, possible ischemic bowel. 

Plan: The acute care surgery service was asked to evaluate the claimant given the possibility of ischemic bowel raised by radiology. They planned to admit and observe the claimant with serial exams. Although enteritis was considered more likely due to the claimant's improved comfort with toradol and zofran alone and normal lactate, the team decided to monitor closely for potential ischemic bowel.",

5348,Reese Kerr,Rowan Kerr,Lisa A. Weidner (Harper Monroe),Maple Ridge Medical,"Sep 29, 2015",6,"HPI: The claimant presented for initial evaluation and treatment of low back and right lateral thigh pain. The onset of her pain occurred on May 28th while assisting a patient to the bathroom at work. As the patient was losing balance, the claimant reached over to catch them, which is when she experienced the pain. She reported two additional episodes of pain from lifting patients in her position as a nursing assistant at Casey Carver. She described her pain as uncomfortable, moderate, miserable, burning, throbbing, and squeezing. The pain was reported as constant. She experienced pain in her right lower extremity with standing, needing to shift her weight. When the pain was intense, her leg felt as if it would give out, though she had not fallen. She required no walker or cane to ambulate. She reported associated sleep disturbance from her pain and difficulty sitting upright due to increased low back pain. 

Exam: The claimant was oriented to person, place, and time. She appeared well-developed and well-nourished with no distress. Cardiovascular exam revealed normal rate and regular rhythm. Pulmonary exam showed normal effort and breath sounds with no respiratory distress. Musculoskeletal exam exhibited tenderness and no edema. She was pushed to stand and displayed non-antalgic gait with symmetric strength in lower extremities. Decreased thoracolumbar range of motion was noted. There was tenderness to palpation in the mid-thoracic spine, lumbar spine, and lumbar paravertebral muscles, greater on the right than left. Patrick's test elicited low back pain on the right. Neurological exam found her alert and oriented with normal reflexes. Sensation to light touch was intact. Skin was warm and dry without erythema. Psychiatric assessment revealed normal mood, affect, and behavior. Vital signs were: blood pressure 154/82 mmHg, pulse 96, height 5'7.5"" (1.715 m), weight 200 lb (90.719 kg), BMI 30.84 kg/m2, and SpO2 96%. 

Diagnoses: Spondylosis of lumbar region without myelopathy or radiculopathy, Low back pain with right-sided sciatica, Lumbar stenosis. 

Plan: The practitioner planned to proceed with diagnostic lumbar facet injections, potentially followed by lumbar medial branch injections. If there was no response to these injections, the practitioner considered an epidural steroid injection (ESI) using a transforaminal approach. The practitioner suggested adjusting antidepressant medications, considering prescribing either Cymbalta or Effexor to replace Elavil and Paxil, but made no changes to the antidepressant medications at that time. The practitioner expressed concern about the use of Ultram with both Elavil and Paxil. Gabapentin was added to the claimant's medication regimen. The claimant was instructed to return for an injection.
