24,ED Provider Note — Amended,Emergency,Joseph Lister,Wuthering Heights Dispensary,"Nov 22, 2019",6,"HPI: The claimant presented with headache and pain in the right eye following a motor vehicle accident (MVA) with airbag deployment one week prior on 11/15/2019. She had been seen in the emergency department immediately after the accident and had a CT of her cervical spine at that time. Over the past week, her eye pain had been worsening. She was seen at urgent care two days ago and started on a topical antibiotic ophthalmic medication. She reported a burning sensation and itching on the surface of her eyeball, as well as deep pain on that side radiating into her face and head. She described it as feeling similar to being hit in the eye with a baseball. The claimant noted minor blurriness in her vision which had slowly progressed. She reported having some mild ecchymosis yesterday, though this was not apparent on the day of presentation. Light bothered her affected eye, but shining light in the left eye did not cause pain in the right. She wore glasses during the accident, which presumably protected her eye as they did not break. The claimant rated her pain as 3 out of 10. 

Exam: The claimant's vital signs were recorded as temperature 97°F (36.1°C), pulse 75, respirations 16, blood pressure 149/96, and oxygen saturation 100%. Orthostatic vital signs were taken, with blood pressure readings of 149/96 lying down, 127/62 sitting, and 121/57 at a later time. Pulse rates during orthostatic testing were 75, 79, and 78. On physical examination, the claimant was oriented to person, place, and time. Her head was normocephalic and atraumatic. External ears were normal bilaterally. The nose was normal. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. Conjunctivae and extraocular movements were normal. No scleral icterus was noted. Neck had normal range of motion and was supple. Cardiovascular exam revealed normal rate, regular rhythm, normal heart sounds, and intact distal pulses. No murmur was heard. Respiratory effort was normal with normal breath sounds. No wheezes or rales were present. Abdominal exam was soft with normal bowel sounds, no distension, mass, tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Musculoskeletal exam showed normal range of motion without edema, tenderness, or deformity. No cervical adenopathy was found. Neurological exam revealed the claimant to be alert and oriented, with no cranial nerve deficit or sensory deficit. Skin was warm and dry with capillary refill less than 2 seconds. No rash or diaphoresis was noted. Psychiatric exam showed normal mood, affect, behavior, judgment, and thought content. A slit-lamp examination was performed, which showed no evidence of traumatic iritis. Fluorescein staining and slit-lamp exam revealed no corneal ulcers or abrasions. Intraocular pressure was measured using a Tono-Pen, with readings of 12 in the right eye and 15 in the left eye. A CT scan of the facial bones without contrast was performed, showing no nasal bone fracture or orbital fracture. 

Diagnoses: Burning sensation of eye, Headache. 

Plan: The claimant was recommended follow-up with Ophthalmology if symptoms persisted. A CT scan of the facial bones was performed, which showed no fractures. The claimant was discharged home in stable condition. The practitioner advised the claimant to call Brian Willard, MD in Ophthalmology if symptoms worsened. The claimant was instructed to continue taking escitalopram and oxybutynin as previously prescribed.

She reported being able to tolerate more visual activity with less strain and headache. Fatigue, mental concentration, and word finding remained significant problems. When performing VTS-4 and SVI in vision therapy, she experienced discomfort that resolved shortly after, whereas initially she would have to lay down after getting home. Her right eye still felt off, which had been the case since the injury. She experienced photosensitivity, particularly with computer screens and bright sunlight. Headache frequency was improving. On 11/15/2019, she was a restrained driver in a vehicle collision where another vehicle pulled out of a parking lot in front of her. There was positive airbag deployment, and she believed she lost consciousness. She reported eye fatigue, eye discomfort, eye strain, and blurred vision at times, though these symptoms were improving in severity. She could tolerate more visual activity before symptoms onset, with symptoms worse in the right eye. Headaches were mild, occurring 2 days a week, and were frontal/anterior vertex in location. They were described as pounding, especially with eye use or exercises. She experienced occasional loss of balance during exercise class. The claimant also reported difficulty finding words at times and feeling that her mental focus and concentration were terrible. 

Exam: The claimant was oriented to person, place, and time. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular motions were normal. The right pupil had regular shape, brisk reactivity, intact consensual response, and intact accommodation. The left pupil showed the same characteristics. There was no CN III or CN VI palsy, no nystagmus, no diplopia, and no ophthalmoparesis. Upgaze, downgaze, and conjugate gaze were normal. Visual acuities with glasses were 20/20 OD and OS at distance, 20/30 OD and 20/20 OS at near. Ishihara color vision testing was 7/7 OD and OS. Randot stereopsis was 140 seconds of arc. Cover test showed orthophoria at distance and 2 prism diopters of exophoria at near. Near point of convergence was 2 inches break and 3 inches recovery. Extraocular muscle testing revealed full range of motion. Pursuits were full range (5/5) and saccades were accurate horizontally and vertically with no asymmetry. Refraction showed a final prescription of OD +2.50 sph with +2.25 add and OS +2.50 -0.25 x 090 with +2.25 add. Von Graefe testing showed 0 lateral and vertical phoria at distance, and 14 prism diopters of exophoria at near. Vergence testing and accommodation testing were performed with specific values recorded. 

Diagnoses: Binocular vision disorder with convergence insufficiency, Primary, Eye pain right, Saccadic eye movement deficiency. 

Plan: The claimant was recommended to continue full-time glasses wear. In-office vision therapy was discontinued, but the claimant was instructed to return for re-evaluation in 3 months to ensure no regression. Home vision therapy activities were prescribed, including use of a brock string. A new single-vision/multi-focal spectacle prescription was issued for full-time/part-time wear, to be worn for all near-centered activities. The prescription included therapeutic prism and therapeutic tint. The practitioner concluded that the claimant had made significant progress with convergence insufficiency in vision therapy, with fusional ranges now in normal ranges. Eye pain in the right eye had improved but still occurred intermittently with headaches or increased visual activity."

698,Report — Amended,Assessment Report,Sir William Osler,Barchester Infirmary,"Aug 19, 2020",8,"Medical History: The claimant had a history of C-section, fibroids, and left knee surgery. She had experienced neck pain about four years prior to the accident, with right arm pain, numbness and weakness. She believed she had seen a chiropractor and had an MRI at that time, which showed degenerative changes in her spine. She had recovered 100 percent from those symptoms prior to the accident on 11/15/2019. The claimant also had a history of depression. She reported having minor motor vehicle accidents in the past, but did not require any diagnostics or treatment for any complaints from those incidents. 

HPI: Claimant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11/15/2019 while working as a community health worker. A car from her right side cut in front of her, causing an accident. She tried to swerve, but the front passenger side of her vehicle hit the front driver's side of the other vehicle. She was wearing a seat belt and air bags deployed. She believed she hit her head and lost consciousness for an uncertain period of time. When she woke up, her head was resting on the steering wheel. She had a cut over her right eye, neck and wrist pain, and her ears sounded clogged. She felt foggy. She went to the Emergency Room where she was evaluated and discharged home. Days later, her eyes felt irritated and burning. She went to Patient First and received eye drops, but was told to return to the Emergency Room for a CT scan of the head. She went back to the Emergency Room where she believed she had a CT scan and was discharged home. She was sent to a concussion doctor where she received physical therapy, occupational therapy, and vision therapy. She was told to see an optometrist. She developed tinnitus in both ears weeks after the accident. She reported burning in her eyes, photophobia, and pain behind her right eye. She had difficulty focusing out of her right eye. She developed daily headaches, imbalance, and cognitive dysfunction. She reported neck pain radiating into the entirety of the right arm and hand, with numbness and tingling. Two days prior to the examination, she was cleared to return to work. 

Medical Encounter: The examination revealed the claimant was a pleasant-appearing woman in no acute distress. Her pupils were equal, round and reactive to light. Visual fields were full to confrontation. Extraocular movements were full with no nystagmus noted. Normal pursuit, saccades and accommodation. The face was symmetric with normal sensation. The tongue and uvula were midline. Normal bulk and tone with no abnormal movements. Strength was 5/5 in the arms and legs. The sensory examination was normal to all modalities. Coordination testing was normal. Her gait was narrow based. She was able to stand on her heels and toes and perform a deep knee bend. Romberg's sign was negative. She was able to tandem walk. Reflexes were ++ and symmetric. Hoffman's sign was negative and plantar responses were flexor. No tenderness to palpation over paraspinal muscles or the head. No palpable spasm or limited range of motion. No scars. 

Conclusions: Concluded that the claimant likely experienced a head contusion and post-traumatic headaches from the accident on 11/15/2019, but it was highly unlikely she had a concussion. Even if she did have a concussion, it would have been a self-limited injury with recovery expected in weeks to months. He determined that treatment beyond 2-4 months was excessive. Dr. Margolies opined that the claimant had fully recovered from the accident and required no additional diagnostics or treatments. He stated she had no restrictions whatsoever. He noted her complaints of pain and numbness throughout the entire right arm and hand were non-physiologic in nature. Dr. Margolies found the claimant's examination to be completely normal with no evidence of any central or peripheral nervous system disorder. 

Recommendations: The assessor concluded that Ms. Morsch had fully recovered from the accident that occurred on 11/15/2019. He stated that no additional diagnostics or treatments were indicated. The assessor determined that she had absolutely no restrictions whatsoever and was able to return to work without limitations. "

HPI: On 02/05/2020, claimant visited for treatment for acute/active care on visit 8 out of a projected 24 visits. Chief Complaint included anterior head, right anterior trapezius, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, left side of neck, posterior cervical (neck), right side of neck, left trapezius, upper thoracic, right posterior trapezius, left posterior shoulder, right posterior shoulder, right triceps, left mid thoracic, mid thoracic, right midthoracic, left lower
thoracic, lower thoracic, right lower thoracic and right lumbar aching, burning, dull, stiffness, tightness and tingling discomfort. Claimant stated this complaint has stayed the same since the last visit. ADL Change included employment, homemaking, lifting, personal care (washing, dressing, etc.), sleeping, social life, traveling and/or driving
and walking has stayed the same. Current Functional Deficits included caring for family, concentrating, driving car, exercising, getting to sleep, performing household chores, lifting objects, looking over shoulder, reaching overhead, staying asleep and using a computer. Pain Scale included Discomfort level, for this complaint since last encounter, at its worst was rated 7/10 reported using Verbal or Visual Analog Scale.

Exam: On 02/05/2020, Spinal restrictions/subluxations were noted at occiput, C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T1, T2, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, right T10 and right T11. Extraspinal restrictions/subluxations were found at the left scapula, right scapula and right shoulder. Pain/tenderness was present in the upper to mid cervical, mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, upper thoracic and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis stated head forward flexed and thoracic hyper-kyphosis. Muscle spasms rated 4/10 were noted in the left anterior shoulder, posterior head, left posterior shoulder, left triceps, left mid thoracic and left lower thoracic. Muscle spasms rated 6/10 were found in the anterior head, right anterior trapezius, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, posterior head, left side of neck, right side of neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right mid thoracic, right lower thoracic and right lumbar regions. Range of motion in the cervical spine was moderately reduced with pain. Thoracic flexion, extension and bilateral rotation were moderately reduced with pain. Right shoulder abduction, flexion and internal rotation were mildly reduced with pain. Assessment revealed no change and consistent with history.  

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals. Based on her history and examination, it was reasonable to believe that her recovery may take longer than an average patient with an uncomplicated case. The claimant tolerated cervical spine passive ROM stretching well, with little upper extremity referral or spasming noted. Treatment was rendered without incident and responding as expected. 

Plan: The treatment plan began on 01/09/2020 and was projected to be completed by an unknown date. It includes Drop Table and Mechanical or instrument-Chiropractic Manipulative Treatment (CMT) to the cervical dorsal spinal region, lumbar spinal region, lumbosacral spinal region, cervical spinal region and right shoulder at a frequency and duration of 2 visits per week for 6 weeks followed by a re-exam within 42 days. The plan also includes therapeutic massage, laser stimulation, hot pack application, Y-Axis mechanical traction, passive and active stretching, and manipulation of extremity joints. Ultrasound therapy was also part of the treatment plan. The claimant was instructed in home care recommendations including home hot pack application and ice for 20 minutes for pain. Short-term goal is to increase ability to perform daily activities that have become difficult within 42 days. Long-term goal is to attain pre-condition/pre-injury status. Treatment effectiveness will be evaluated using functional outcome assessment tools including Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale Questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and Neck Pain Disability Index Questionnaire, with a goal score of 10% or better.

719,Independent Medical Examination – Updated,Assessment Report,Frederick Banting,Bleak House Sanatorium,"Apr 08, 2021",6,"Medical History: The claimant had a cesarean section in 12/01/2000 and a fibroidectomy in 01/01/1999. She underwent knee surgery in the mid 1990's. She reported having neck pain in approximately 2016, for which she received chiropractic treatment for an estimated six months duration by Dr. Smith, including traction, with resolution of symptoms thereafter. Her medical history also included endometrial ablation, left knee arthroscopic surgery, myomectomy in 1999, and thyroidectomy. The claimant denied a history of headaches or previous concussions. 

HPI: The claimant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11/15/2019 when she was the restrained driver of her Ford Explorer. Another vehicle pulled out of a gas station driveway, and the claimant T-boned the other vehicle. Air bags deployed, and she experienced loss of consciousness of unknown duration. She was transported by ambulance to St. Luke's Bethlehem Campus emergency department where she was evaluated, including diagnostic testing, and released the same day. The claimant reported immediate onset of symptoms after the accident, describing feeling like she was ""in a fishbowl"" with muffled voices and confusion. She experienced ""burning pain"" in the right eye associated with photophobia. She was evaluated at Patient First and subsequently referred to the Lehigh Valley Hospital Network Concussion Clinic. The claimant received physical and occupational therapy for approximately two months, and vision therapy for about five months. She was also evaluated by a neuro optometrist, Dr. Heldi Sensenig, with whom she received treatment over several months. The claimant received chiropractic treatment by Dr. Robert Smith for her cervical spine until September 2020. Her primary complaint at the time of examination was constant neck pain, greater than right upper extremity pain to the hand. She reported persistent right periorbital pain worsened by computer use and reading, as well as ongoing naming issues. 

Medical Encounter: The claimant was a 5'8"" tall, 150lb female who appeared in no apparent distress. She was independent in mobility without assistance or assistive devices. Her gait was normal, and she could perform heel and toe walking without weakness. Romberg test was negative, and she could perform tandem gait. Spinal contours were within normal limits. Cervical spine range of motion was full, but she reported right-sided neck pain radiating into the scapula at end range of right lateral side bending, rotation, and extension. Right Spurling maneuver reproduced right upper extremity paresthesia. Upper extremity range of motion was otherwise full and painless. Palpation revealed focal tenderness in the right cervical paraspinals without associated spasm. No trigger points were found in the upper quarters, and the right shoulder was non-tender throughout. Neurological examination showed no focal atrophy, fasciculations, or deformities. Manual muscle testing was normal (grade 5/5) in the C5-T1 myotomes bilaterally. Reflexes were grade 2/4 and symmetrical bilaterally at the biceps, brachioradialis, and triceps. Hoffmann reflex was negative, and no ankle clonus. Sensation was intact to light touch in the upper extremity dermatomes bilaterally. Upper limb tension test was negative. Shoulder impingement signs were negative. No mid arc pain. Tinel's sign was negative over the carpal and cubital tunnels. 

Conclusions: The examiner concluded that the claimant had not achieved maximum medical improvement nor fully recovered from the injuries sustained in the 11/15/2019 motor vehicle accident. The diagnoses related to the accident were concussion/post-concussion syndrome and cervical strain/sprain. The claimant had persistent symptoms primarily associated with the cervical spine injury. Her prognosis for full recovery was guarded given the duration of symptoms despite treatment. The examiner recommended further diagnostic testing including MRI of the cervical spine and electrodiagnostic testing of the right upper extremity. Depending on results, the claimant may be a candidate for interventional therapies. The examiner determined the claimant continued to have physical limitations as a direct result of the accident, including limited tolerance for reading (especially on screens), limited tolerance for certain cervical spine postures, and limited lifting tolerance greater than 10 pounds, especially above shoulder level. 

Recommendations: The assessor recommended further diagnostic testing including MRI of the cervical spine and electrodiagnostic testing (EMG/NCS studies) of the right upper extremity. Based on the results of this testing, suggested the claimant may be a candidate for interventional therapies such as epidural steroid injection, diagnostic medial branch blockade and/or radiofrequency neurotomy. The assessor stated the claimant had not achieved maximum medical improvement nor fully recovered from her injuries. He indicated she continued to have physical limitations as a direct result of the 11/15/2019 motor vehicle accident, including limited tolerance for reading especially on video screens, limited tolerance for certain cervical spine postures, and limited lifting tolerance of greater than 10 pounds especially above shoulder level.

HPI: The claimant presented with post-concussion/headache symptoms due to a motor vehicle accident that occurred on 11/15/2019. She was alone in the vehicle when another vehicle pulled out in front of her. The airbag deployed, but she did not recall this. She lost consciousness for a few minutes and awoke with her head on the steering wheel. She was transported to the ER via ambulance. Over the next few days, she began experiencing symptoms including burning and itching eyes, throbbing head, light sensitivity, and feeling off balance. She went to urgent care about 5 days later due to these symptoms and was referred to a concussion specialist, who then referred her to physical therapy. The claimant reported constant pain behind her right eye and a throbbing head. She experienced increased dizziness and nausea with certain activities/positions of movement, including elevators, transitions, getting up too fast, and bending over. She also reported neck pain with radiating symptoms down her right upper extremity. Within the past week, she started experiencing tinnitus that lasted for a few minutes. Her current pain rating was 3, with a best pain rating of 3 and worst pain rating of 6. The pain was located in her neck and behind her right eye, with dizziness and headache. Sudden movements and head turning/looking up aggravated her symptoms, while avoiding extreme movements provided relief. The claimant's condition was worsening. 

Exam: The claimant demonstrated forward head and rounded shoulder posture. Cervical active range of motion appeared to be negative in all planes. Single leg stance testing showed 30 seconds bilaterally. Tandem stance was held for 20 seconds with left leg forward and 30 seconds with right leg forward. Gait assessment revealed independent ambulation without a device, with mild muscle guarding noted. The claimant demonstrated safety awareness consistent with independent living. Vertebral artery testing elicited initial dizziness/lightheadedness when rotating/extending the neck to the right, which subsided on repetition. Alar ligament test and Sharp Purser test were negative. Convergence testing measured 41 cm with blurry vision reported. Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) x1 testing elicited mild dizziness. VOR cancellation test produced notable dizziness, headache, and nausea. Smooth pursuit testing appeared negative in both vertical and horizontal planes. Saccade testing in vertical and horizontal planes elicited mild dizziness and headache. Finger-to-nose test was negative. The treatment diagnoses confirmed by examination were concussion with brief loss of consciousness and post-concussion headache. 

Rehabilitation Potential: Not available. 

Plan: The treatment plan included manual therapy such as passive range of motion, soft tissue mobilization, and myofascial release to decrease pain and increase range of motion. Therapeutic exercises were planned to increase functional mobility, range, strength, and endurance. Therapeutic activities were to be used to improve functional mobility, endurance, and gait/ambulation. Neuromuscular re-education was planned to enhance muscle recruitment, coordination, independence in self-care, vestibulo-oculomotor training, and balance/gait as necessary. Modalities were to be performed as needed to reduce pain/inflammation and increase functional mobility. Claimant education was to be provided on proper posture, positioning, joint protection strategies, pacing for safe return to activities, use of adaptive equipment, and home program. The claimant was to be seen 1-2 times per week for 10 visits over 5 weeks. Short-term goals included reporting 50% improvement in headache and dizziness symptoms and demonstrating independence with initial home exercise program. Long-term goals included reporting 80% improvement in symptoms, demonstrating near normal cervical range of motion, performing tandem stance and single leg stance for 30 seconds each side, achieving 0% level of disability on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory and Headache Disability Inventory, and demonstrating near normal age-related findings on Sensory Organization Test (>70% if administered).

During static stance testing on foam with head turns and nods, the claimant showed increased sway with eyes closed, indicating continued proprioceptive deficits. During ambulation with eyes closed, she exhibited good pace and no imbalance, but had mild path deviation initially to the right side. The claimant was able to correct this deviation with repeated testing as she reported improved ability to sense and correct the imbalance. Toward the end of the session, she demonstrated improved ability to utilize balance master training to correct balance with dynamic activities. 

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant's rehabilitation potential was good. She demonstrated good compliance with therapy and consistent follow-through. 

Plan: The treatment plan included continued skilled intervention for pain management and vestibular training. The claimant completed therapeutic exercise for 10 minutes and neuromuscular re-education for 40 minutes during the session. Interventions focused on safety and compensation strategies, impaired balance and coordination, stability with standing activities, functional limitations restricting ADLs and work performance, and home program. Specific exercises included balance master training with weight shifting and variable background/floor movement for proprioceptive challenge, static stance with head turns and nods on foam, and ambulation with eyes closed. The plan was to continue the current plan of care. "
850,Outpatient Physical Therapy Encounter Note (Addendum),Physiotherapy,Emily Stowe,Hogsmeade Urgent Care,"Jun 01, 2020",1,"Referral Diagnoses: Not available. 

HPI: The claimant reported her complaints showed no change. She reported her symptoms were improved, but she continued to have a daily headache which increased in intensity with eye exercises. Her pain level prior to the session was 4/10 for headache/cervicalgia. The claimant reported no medication changes since the last session. 

Exam: The claimant tolerated increased treadmill intensity with speed increased to 2.6 MPH and incline to 3% during exercise, with heart rate monitoring increased to 107 bpm during session, with no symptom provocation. Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) exercises were performed with increased intensity: VOR-1 for 60 seconds, saccades and smooth pursuit for 60 seconds with far-far-saccades (looking out window, landscape targets). Provocation of dizziness with increased VOR-1 intensity was observed, resolving in 45-60 seconds. Single leg stance was performed with cognitive challenge (adding 7's, subtracting 4's), with the claimant continuing to balance well but some errors with math noted. BOSU challenges included head nods and VOR-CX (horizontal), with the claimant fatiguing by the end of the exercise. Manual thoracic spine examination (Grade III to IV) revealed cavitation of T6, T5 and T4 with minimal pressure. The claimant demonstrated increased cervical mobility following manual therapy. First and second rib manual examination (Grade II to III) was performed. Assessment revealed the following the claimant demonstrated fair response to today's treatment with mild symptom provocation during vestibulocular exercises, which was relieved with rest. Improvements were noted in balance as evidenced by single-leg stance (SLS) performance and increased cervical flexibility following thoracic spine mobilizations. Despite progress toward current goals, the claimant continued to experience vestibulocular and balance challenges related to sensory integration, as well as limitations in cervicothoracic mobility and strength. Claimant compliance and understanding of the exercises and educational material are good.

Rehabilitation Potential: Claimant compliance with therapy was good with consistent follow through. 

Plan: Continue the current plan of care with ongoing skilled intervention targeting vestibulocular function, balance with sensory integration, cervicothoracic mobility, and strengthening. The next session will focus on program progression, specifically increasing the challenge of single-leg stance exercises by incorporating visual deprivation techniques."

HPI: The claimant arrived for her last scheduled follow up. She reported continuing to have headaches, especially with her oculomotor and vision therapy interventions. She continued to go to chiropractor for cervical spine care. The claimant stated that when she saw the referring provider and vision therapist, they may recommend metronome therapy. She stated that with 4 different therapies, she felt she would be fine to discharge from PT in order to focus on the other therapies. The claimant reported current pain as 2 out of 10 on VAPS, with pain at best being 2 and at worst being 5. 

Exam: The claimant demonstrated cervical spine range of motion as follows, flexion 47 degrees, extension 45 degrees, right side bend 30 degrees, left side bend 32 degrees, right rotation 75 degrees, and left rotation 68 degrees. Thoracic spine range of motion was assessed as 40 degrees right rotation and 46 degrees left rotation. Balance testing revealed good static and dynamic balance in both sitting and standing positions. Vestibular examination showed a negative Rhomberg test and normal gaze-evoked nystagmus on Frenzel lens testing. The Sensory Organization Test score was 70%, meeting the standard but 1% below norm. Oculomotor screening revealed ocular range of motion within functional limits, convergence at 7 cm, slight undershoot to left side on saccades testing, and ability to maintain stable gaze at fast speeds during vestibulo-ocular reflex testing. The Head Impulse Test was positive to the left side and equivocal to the right side, while the Head Shake Test was negative. Mobility assessment showed independent sit-to-stand, stand pivot, and lateral transfer abilities. The claimant demonstrated smooth pursuit deficits on vestibular and oculomotor testing. Treatment diagnoses confirmed during the visit included concussion with loss of consciousness <= 30 minutes (subsequent encounter), whiplash injury syndrome (subsequent encounter), oculomotor apraxia, and concussion with brief loss of consciousness. Assessment revealed, she demonstrated mild symptom provocation with vestibulocular exercises, which was relieved with rest. She showed improved balance with single leg stance and improved sense of cervical flexibility with thoracic spine mobilizations. The claimant required continued skilled intervention for vestibulocular challenges, balance challenges with sensory integration, and cervical-thoracic mobility and strengthening. Her compliance with therapy was good with consistent follow-through. She demonstrated understanding of the exercises and educational material presented.

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant's rehabilitation potential was fair.  

Plan: The claimant was discharged from physical therapy at this time. The plan included continuing with vision therapy, chiropractic care, and possibly speech therapy with metronome training. The claimant was educated on continuing physical therapy for visual training including convergence and forced use training of the oculomotor system. Brock string and FFS activities were added to the home exercise program. Short-term rehabilitation goals included demonstrating independence in performing the home exercise program with proper form and understanding of rationale, performing the TM Test with subthreshold heart rate established to promote increased cerebral blood flow and improved recovery from mild traumatic brain injury, performing the Sensory Organization Test and Dynamic Visual Acuity test, and demonstrating improved cervical movement and motor control with vestibulo-ocular reflex at least 60 beats per minute. Long-term rehabilitation goals included scoring within normal limits for age group on the Sensory Organization Test, improving Functional Gait Assessment score to greater than or equal to 30/30, improving convergence to less than 5 cm, reporting ability to perform all activities of daily living and reading without complaints of headache or dizziness, tolerating 2 minutes of vestibulo-ocular reflex with full field stimulus, tolerating handheld vestibulo-ocular reflex in ambulation for 90 seconds without symptom provocation, and improving Dizziness Handicap Inventory score by 18 points.

EMS was activated and assisted her out of the vehicle. Initially, she experienced a sensation of being ""in a fish bowl,"" difficulty processing information, and slowed speech. She sustained a laceration near her right eyebrow from her glasses, a swollen tender area on the inner aspect of her left arm above the wrist, sore knuckles, and a laceration inside her upper lip. She was transported to St. Luke's Hospital ER where a cervical CT was negative for fracture; no head CT was performed initially. Following the accident, the claimant developed pounding headaches, photophobia, and mental fogginess. She returned to work on 11/18/19 but experienced worsening symptoms including eye burning, eye pain, facial pain, and continued headaches. Further evaluation at Patient First led to a referral back to St. Luke's ER where a CT of the facial bones was performed, showing no fractures or abnormalities. She was enrolled in a concussion program starting 1/10/20 and was referred to physical therapy with vestibular focus, occupational therapy for cognitive rehabilitation, and neuro-optometry for vision therapy. She attended vision therapy but treatments were interrupted due to COVID-19 restrictions. A phone visit on 5/1/20 confirmed continuation of therapies. At a follow-up visit on 7/15/20, the claimant reported ongoing symptoms including trouble staying asleep, daytime drowsiness, fatigue, noise sensitivity, intermittent tinnitus, eye fatigue and strain, blurred vision in the right eye, photophobia, nausea associated with eye use and dizziness, posterior cervical aching and tightness, mild frontal headaches occurring most days but not daily, dizziness with position changes, intermittent right upper extremity numbness and tingling, mental fogginess, slowed thinking, difficulty focusing, concentrating, and remembering, as well as irritability, sadness, nervousness, and overall increased emotionality.

The neurological examination revealed that the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time, although she experienced word-finding difficulties. Her speech was clear and appropriate. Cranial nerve assessment showed that pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, with no evidence of cranial nerve III or VI palsy, nystagmus, or diplopia. Facial sensation and expression were intact and symmetric, and hearing was preserved. Motor examination indicated normal muscle bulk and tone bilaterally, with no pronator drift observed in either arm. Strength testing demonstrated 5/5 strength in all assessed muscle groups, including deltoids, biceps, triceps, interossei, iliopsoas, quadriceps, and hamstrings on both sides. Sensory examination noted intermittent numbness and tingling in the right upper extremity. Gait was normal, although the patient reported occasional feelings of being off balance. Coordination tests showed a negative Romberg, despite some swaying, and normal finger-to-nose and tandem walking coordination, with some guidance required for tandem gait testing. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetric and normal, with biceps and patellar reflexes graded 2+ bilaterally. Balance testing via BESS revealed scores of 0/10 on double leg stance, 3/10 on tandem stance, and 3/10 on single leg stance. Ocular motor testing showed hypometric, slow saccadic eye movements, difficulty maintaining eye movement, and exacerbation of eye pain and headaches. Gaze stability testing was positive for dizziness, tinnitus, and headache.

On 11/15/2019, she was a restrained driver in a vehicle collision where another car pulled out in front of her. There was airbag deployment, and she believed she lost consciousness. Currently, she reported being able to tolerate more visual activity with less strain and headache. However, fatigue, mental concentration, and word finding remained significant problems. She experienced discomfort during certain vision therapy exercises, though it now resolved shortly after, whereas initially she would have to lay down after getting home. The claimant reported that her right eye still felt off, as it had since the injury. Computer screen lights and bright sun bothered her. She noted improving frequency of headaches. She completed 21 sessions of vision therapy at Concussion and Head Trauma, with the most recent session on 08/11/2020. She tolerated and participated in sessions well, although they could sometimes bring on nausea or headache. 

Exam: The claimant was oriented to person, place, and time. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular motions were normal. The right and left pupils had regular shape, brisk reactivity, intact consensual response, and intact accommodation. No CN III or VI palsy, nystagmus, diplopia, or ophthalmoparesis was observed. Upgaze, downgaze, and conjugate gaze were normal. Visual acuities were 20/20 for distance and with glasses 20/30 OD, 20/20 OS  and OU for near vision and distance. Ishihara color vision testing showed 7/7 correct for both eyes. Randot stereopsis was 140 seconds of arc. Cover test revealed orthophoria at distance and 2 prism diopters of exophoria at near. Near point of convergence was 2 inches break and 3 inches recovery. Extraocular muscle testing showed full range of motion. Pursuits were full range (5/5) and saccades were accurate horizontally and vertically with no asymmetry. Refraction testing was performed with final prescription of +2.50 sphere OD and +2.50 -0.25 x090 OS, both with +2.25 add, yielding 20/20 vision at distance and near. Pupillary distance was 59.0 mm. Phoria testing using the Von Graefe method showed 0 lateral and vertical phoria at distance, and 14 prism diopters of exophoria at near. Vergence testing revealed blur/break/recovery values for various directions. Accommodation testing showed NRA/PRA values of +0.75/-1.00 and fused cross cylinder of +2.00. 

Diagnoses: Binocular vision disorder with convergence insufficiency, Eye pain (right), Saccadic eye movement deficiency. 

Plan: The practitioner recommended continuing full-time glasses wear. In-office vision therapy was discontinued, with a return visit scheduled for re-evaluation in 3 months to ensure no regression. The claimant was advised to perform home vision therapy activities as prescribed, including using the brock string at home. The practitioner instructed the claimant to contact them if there was difficulty with home activities. A new single-vision/multi-focal spectacle prescription was issued for full-time/part-time wear, with glasses to be worn for all near-centered activities. The prescription included therapeutic prism and therapeutic tint. Practitioner advised to initiate vision therapy to address above diagnoses; schedule twice a week x 24 sessions followed by re-evaluation with HLS."

HPI: The claimant presented on 04/12/2022 noting that her neck had been ""really fired up,"" although stretching and Advil had helped. She reported her hips may be improving, but she had stopped working out for about a week which felt like a setback. Her chief complaints included dull, aching and burning discomfort in the right anterior trapezius, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, right anterior pelvis/hip, left anterior pelvis/hip, posterior head, left side of neck, right side of neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right triceps and right mid thoracic regions. The claimant stated this complaint had returned since the last visit. She reported worsening in homemaking, lifting, sleeping and traveling and/or driving activities. Her current functional deficits included caring for family, concentrating, driving car, exercising, getting to sleep, performing household chores, lifting objects, looking over shoulder, reaching overhead, sitting, staying asleep, using a computer and participating in yard work. The claimant rated her discomfort level at its worst as 6/10, occurring intermittently. 

Exam: The claimant's neck was quite taut and tender bilaterally, especially on the right side. Anterior hip laser hot spots were noted around the ASIS and just medial/superior. Daily objective findings showed spinal restrictions or subluxations at C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, and T1 through T8. Extraspinal restrictions or subluxations were found in the left scapula, right scapula, and right shoulder. Pain and tenderness were present in the mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, upper thoracic, and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis revealed a forward-flexed head, thoracic hyperkyphosis, and rounded shoulders. Muscle spasms were rated 5 out of 10 in the anterior head, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, posterior head, left side of neck, left trapezius, right posterior shoulder, left mid thoracic, and right lower thoracic tissues. Additional muscle spasms were rated 6 out of 10 in the right anterior trapezius, right side of neck, right posterior trapezius, and right mid thoracic tissues. Range of motion concerns included moderately reduced cervical extension, left rotation, left lateral flexion, and right lateral flexion, accompanied by mild to moderate pain. Thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation were also moderately reduced with mild stiffness and pain. Right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation were not reduced but showed mild stiffness, primarily in abduction and internal rotation. An exacerbation was indicated in the claimant’s subjective and objective evaluations conducted on the day of assessment.  Based on her history and examination, it was reasonable to believe that her recovery may take longer than an average patient with an uncomplicated case. She had duration of current episode longer than 1 month, positive MRI findings, severity of initial episode of injury, and waited more than 7 days to seek treatment. The claimant related improvement after treatment. Treatment was rendered without incident. The treatment diagnosis was  cervical disc degeneration at the C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 levels, other muscle spasm, segmental and somatic dysfunction of the thoracic region, other specified dorsopathies of the thoracic region, and pain in the right and left hips.

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals.

Plan: The treatment plan included hot moist pack applied to posterior cervical region for 10 minutes, Y-Axis mechanical traction applied to mid to lower cervical for 8 minutes with 9 lbs in 20 degrees of flexion, laser treatment for 3 minutes to bilateral iliac artery, and laser stimulation for 5 minutes at 500-5000 Hz to each anterior superior hip/ASIS region. Passive and active stretching was performed on cervical spine, scapulothoracic, and right shoulder regions for 8 minutes. Manipulation of extremity joints was performed on right shoulder and bilateral scapulothoracic joints. Chiropractic manipulation was performed to all regions using low force techniques. The claimant was advised to return as soon as possible. Short-term rehabilitation goals included increasing ability to perform activities like showering, concentrating, dressing, sleeping, grocery shopping, household chores, lifting, looking over shoulder, reaching overhead, and using a computer within 42 days. The long-term goal was to attain pre-condition/pre-injury status. he claimant experienced difficulty with daily activities and employment due to her condition. The short-term goal was to improve her functional abilities within 42 days, aiming to return to her pre-injury status long-term. Treatment involved approximately 12 to 18 chiropractic visits targeting multiple spinal regions and the right shoulder, scheduled twice weekly for six weeks, followed by re-evaluation. Treatment effectiveness was to be assessed using objective findings and disability questionnaires, with a goal of at least 10% improvement. The claimant was also advised on home care, including the use of hot packs and icing for pain management.

Trigger points were more pronounced in the right upper trapezius and right medial scapula compared to the left, with reduced scapular retraction mobility. Cervical spine lateral rotation measured 64 degrees left and 58 degrees right, with some associated pain. Bilateral Kemp’s test elicited segmental pain rated 5 out of 10 at T2 through T7 without radiation. Distraction test relieved segmental and radiating pain at right C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1. Maximum foramina compression bilaterally produced pain rated 6 out of 10, greater on the right, at C2/C3, C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1 with radiation. Shoulder depression test also caused pain rated 6 out of 10 bilaterally, greater on the right, at C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1 with radiating pain. Percussion test elicited mid and upper thoracic pain. Costoclavicular maneuver showed no change in radial pulse bilaterally. Neurological evaluations found the claimant alert, oriented, and cooperative, with normal dermatomal, gross touch, vibration, and light touch sensations in all upper spinal segments. Upper extremity motor testing was mostly normal with slight weakness on the left side in shoulder elevation, deltoid, and triceps muscles. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished bilaterally (1+) in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis. The claimant exhibited spinal restrictions or subluxations at C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, and T1 through T8. Extraspinal restrictions or subluxations were observed in the left scapula, right scapula, and right shoulder.

Muscle spasms were rated at 4 out of 10 in areas including the anterior head, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, posterior head, left side of neck, left trapezius, right posterior shoulder, left mid thoracic, and right lower thoracic tissue tone, while spasms rated 6 out of 10 were noted in the right anterior trapezius, right side of neck, right posterior trapezius, and right mid thoracic tissue tone. Range of motion (ROM) concerns included moderate reductions with mild pain in cervical extension, left rotation, left lateral flexion, and right lateral flexion; moderate reductions with mild stiffness and pain in thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation; and no reduction but mild stiffness mainly in abduction and internal rotation of the right shoulder. The findings were consistent with those indicated in subjective and objective evaluations, and the determination of care was that continued treatment was necessary.  Based on the history and examination, it was reasonable to believe that recovery may take longer than an average case with an uncomplicated presentation. The claimant had duration of current episode longer than 1 month, positive MRI findings, severity of initial episode of injury, and waited more than 7 days to seek treatment. Treatment was rendered without incident and the claimant related improvement after treatment. Continued care was determined to be necessary.  The treatment diagnosis was  cervical disc degeneration at the C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 levels, other muscle spasm, segmental and somatic dysfunction of the thoracic region, other specified dorsopathies of the thoracic region, and pain in the right and left hips.

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals. 

Plan: As per the treatment plan, a hot moist pack was applied to the posterior cervical region for 10 minutes. Y-Axis mechanical traction was administered to the mid to lower cervical spine for 10 minutes using 9 pounds of force at 20 degrees of flexion. Passive and active stretching was performed for 8 minutes, targeting cervical spine range of motion and muscles including the suboccipitals, sternocleidomastoids, levators, upper trapezius, scalenes, and splenius, along with scapulothoracic mobilizations focusing on retraction and circumduction, and right shoulder passive range of motion exercises. Manipulation of extremity joints, specifically the right shoulder and bilateral scapulothoracic joints, was conducted using mobilization techniques and gentle thrusts within patient tolerance. Chiropractic manipulation was also performed on all relevant regions based on clinical findings, utilizing low force techniques such as Activator and drop methods on the upper cervical spine and mid/upper thoracic spine, producing cavitations at the mid thoracic spine. The rationale for therapy was to improve balance, single-leg stance, and endurance; increase time between visits; reduce pain; enhance range of motion; and decrease recurrences. Treatment was rendered without incident, and the claimant reported improvement following the session. The claimant was advised to return as soon as possible for the next visit. The claimant reported that employment had become difficult due to several functional deficits, including challenges with showering or bathing, concentrating, dressing herself, getting to sleep, grocery shopping, performing household chores, lifting objects, looking over her shoulder, reaching overhead, staying asleep, and using a computer. The short-term treatment goal was to increase her ability to perform these activities by the re-examination date within 42 days, unless improvement warranted an earlier discharge. The long-term goal was to attain her pre-condition or pre-injury status. The primary treatment plan included Drop Table and mechanical or instrument-assisted Chiropractic Manipulative Treatment (CMT) targeting the cervical dorsal, lumbar, lumbosacral, cervical spinal regions, and right shoulder, with approximately 12 to 18 visits scheduled at a frequency of two visits per week over the next six weeks, followed by a re-examination within 42 days. Treatment effectiveness was to be evaluated through analysis of objective and subjective findings, along with results from functional outcome assessment tools such as the Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale Questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and Neck Pain Disability Index Questionnaire, with a goal of achieving a 10% or better improvement. For home care, the claimant was instructed to apply a hot pack at home and to ice the affected area for 20 minutes, repeat after 60 minutes if needed, and discontinue icing after three hours.

HPI: The claimant reported a return of right-sided neck symptoms with occasional ""catching."" She had delayed returning for treatment pending settlement of her workers' compensation and medical claims. She described experiencing a little tingling and burning in the arm, with symptoms present ""pretty much every day."" There were no changes in her past medical history. She was not taking any medications regularly, only using Advil or Tylenol about once a month. The claimant currently worked in real estate and managed self-care through stretching and heat application. She typically engaged in Jazzercise five days a week. Additionally, she noted chronic bilateral hip pains.

Exam: Cervical spine range of motion was measured as 44° flexion, 52° extension with pain, 32° left rotation with pain, 30° right rotation, 62° left lateral flexion with pain, and 54° right lateral flexion, more pain in left side versus right side. Neurological and mental status evaluations revealed the claimant was alert, oriented to person, place, and time, and cooperative. Sensory testing bilaterally showed normal dermatomal findings across all upper spinal segments for pain, gross touch, vibration, and light touch sensations. Upper extremity resistive isometric motor testing was normal (5/5) except for slight weakness on the left side: shoulder elevation (left 4+/5, right 5/5), deltoid (left 4+/5, right 5/5), biceps (both sides 5/5), and triceps (left 4+/5, right 5/5). Deep tendon reflexes were slightly diminished bilaterally (1+) in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis. Orthopedic testing included Kemp’s test bilaterally, eliciting 5/10 segmental pain at T2 through T7 without radiation. Distraction test relieved segmental and radiating pain at right C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1. Maximum foraminal compression caused 6/10 pain bilaterally at C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1, greater on the right, with radiation. Shoulder depression test elicited 6/10 pain bilaterally at the same levels with local pain radiating. Percussion with an instrument caused pain in the mid and upper thoracic regions. Costoclavicular maneuver showed no change in the radial pulse bilaterally. The claimant exhibited spinal restrictions and subluxations at multiple levels including C1 through C7 and T1 through T8. Extraspinal restrictions were noted in the left and right scapulae and the right shoulder. Pain and tenderness were present in the mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, upper thoracic, and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis revealed forward head flexion, thoracic hyperkyphosis, and rounded shoulders. Muscle spasms were rated 4 out of 10 in areas including the anterior head, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, posterior head, left side of neck, left trapezius, right posterior shoulder, and left mid thoracic tissue tone, while spasms rated 6 out of 10 were noted in the right anterior trapezius, right side of neck, right posterior trapezius, right mid thoracic, and right lower thoracic tissue tone. Range of motion concerns included moderate reductions with mild pain in cervical extension, left rotation, left lateral flexion, and right lateral flexion; moderate reductions with mild stiffness and pain in thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation; and no reduction but mild stiffness mainly in abduction and internal rotation of the right shoulder. The claimant experienced a return of symptoms as indicated in today’s subjective and objective evaluations. The determination of care was that continued treatment remained necessary.  She had a duration of current episode longer than 1 month, positive MRI findings, severity of initial episode of injury and waited more than 7 days to seek treatment. Based on her history and examination, it was reasonable to believe that her recovery may take longer than an average patient with an uncomplicated case.

HPI: The claimant had attempted to withdraw from care and manage her symptoms at home; however, she experienced persistent right-sided neck pain radiating down the right posterior upper and lower arm to the hand, accompanied by some ""shooting"" pain extending into the back of the neck and head on the right side. Her return to care was also delayed due to multiple visits to her elderly parents in South Carolina, requiring two-week quarantines after each trip. She reported that headaches had been manageable but worsened with high levels of activity or increased neck pain. Her past medical history included completion of physical therapy with release, though she could return on an as-needed basis. Additionally, she noted worsening bilateral anterior hip pain, a recurrence from pregnancy unrelated to the motor vehicle accident. During this acute/active care visit (#21 of a projected 24), the claimant’s chief complaint included dull, aching, and burning discomfort in the anterior head, bilateral anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, bilateral sides of the neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right triceps, right posterior elbow, right posterior forearm, and right mid thoracic region. The claimant stated this complaint had returned since the last visit. Activities of daily living such as homemaking, lifting, sleeping, and traveling or driving had worsened. Current functional deficits included difficulties caring for family, concentrating, driving, exercising, falling and staying asleep, performing household chores, lifting objects, looking over the shoulder, reaching overhead, sitting, using a computer, and participating in yard work. The claimant rated the discomfort since the last encounter at its worst as 6 out of 10 on a verbal or visual analog scale.

Exam: The claimant's cervical spine range of motion was measured as 46 degrees flexion, 55 degrees extension with pain, 27 degrees left lateral flexion, 25 degrees right lateral flexion, 58 degrees left rotation with pain, and 62 degrees right rotation. Grip strength was 57 lbs on the left and 49 lbs on the right with right pinky pain noted. Kemp's Test was performed bilaterally, with the claimant reporting segmental pain rated 5 out of 10 at T2 through T7 levels, without radiation. The Distraction Test provided relief of segmental and radiating pain on the right side at C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1. Maximum Foraminal Compression performed bilaterally elicited pain rated 6 out of 10, greater on the right, at C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1, with radiation. Shoulder Depression Test also caused pain rated 6 out of 10 bilaterally, more intense on the right at the same cervical levels, with local pain radiating. Percussion with an instrument elicited pain in the mid and upper thoracic regions. Costoclavicular Maneuver was performed with no change observed in radial pulse bilaterally. Daily objective findings revealed spinal restrictions and subluxations at cervical levels C1, C2, C5, C6, and C7, as well as thoracic levels T1 through T8. Extraspinal restrictions were noted in the left and right scapulae and the right shoulder. Pain and tenderness were present in the mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, upper thoracic, and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis showed forward head flexion, thoracic hyperkyphosis, and rounded shoulders. Muscle spasms were rated 4 out of 10 in the anterior head, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, posterior head, left side of the neck, left trapezius, right posterior shoulder, and left mid thoracic tissue tone. More severe muscle spasms, rated 6 out of 10, were found in the right anterior trapezius, right side of the neck, right posterior trapezius, right mid thoracic, and right lower thoracic tissue tone. Range of motion concerns included moderate reductions with mild pain in cervical extension, left rotation, left lateral flexion, and right lateral flexion. Thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation were moderately reduced with mild stiffness and pain. Right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation were not reduced but demonstrated mild stiffness, especially during abduction coupled with internal rotation. The claimant was advised to follow up next week due to a regression experienced after withdrawal from care. She continued to suffer from recurrences of neck pain and radiculopathy stemming from the motor vehicle accident. While she could manage symptoms at home for several weeks to months, the symptoms gradually recurred. Daily assessment indicated an exacerbation, as reflected in subjective and objective evaluations. The determination of care was that continued treatment was necessary. Based on her history and examination, it was considered reasonable to believe that her recovery might take longer than that of an average patient with an uncomplicated case. Treatment diagnosis was Strain of muscle, fascia, and tendon at neck level, initial; Other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 levels; Other muscle spasm; Car occupant (driver or passenger) injured in other specified transport accidents, initial encounter; Muscle spasm of back; Other specified dorsopathies of the thoracic region; Concussion without loss of consciousness, initial encounter.

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals. 

Plan: The clinician conducted history taking, evaluation, and assessment of the claimant for 5-8 minutes. Laser stimulation was applied for 8 minutes at 500-5000 Hz to the right lower cervical spine and upper shoulder regions (right side more than left), and for 2 minutes at 5000 Hz to the C5-C7 facets. As per the treatment plan, a hot moist pack was applied to the posterior cervical (neck) region for 10 minutes. Y-Axis mechanical traction was administered to the mid to lower cervical spine for 10 minutes using 9 pounds of force at 20 degrees of flexion. Passive and active stretching were performed for 15 minutes, targeting cervical spine range of motion and muscles including the suboccipitals, sternocleidomastoids, levators, upper trapezius, scalenes, and splenius. Scapulothoracic mobilizations focused on retraction and circumduction, along with right shoulder passive range of motion exercises. Manipulation of extremity joints, specifically the right shoulder and bilateral scapulothoracic joints, was performed using mobilization techniques and gentle thrusts within patient tolerance.

The claimant reported mild improvement in this complaint since the last visit. Activities of daily living such as homemaking, lifting, personal care (washing, dressing, etc.), sleeping, traveling or driving, and walking had improved somewhat. Current functional deficits included difficulties in caring for family, concentrating, driving, exercising, falling asleep, performing household chores, lifting objects, looking over the shoulder, reaching overhead, showering or bathing, staying asleep, and using a computer. The claimant rated the discomfort level since the last encounter at its worst as 4 to 5 out of 10 on a verbal or visual analog scale, with symptoms present approximately 25-33% of awake time.

Exam: The claimant's grip strength was measured at 50 right and 54 left. Cervical spine range of motion was recorded as 45 degrees flexion, 36 degrees extension, 20 degrees left lateral flexion, 28 degrees right lateral flexion, 60 degrees left rotation, and 64 degrees right rotation, with pain mainly in left lateral flexion and left rotation causing shooting pain down the right side. Kemp’s test performed bilaterally elicited segmental pain rated 5 out of 10 at T2 through T7 without radiation. Distraction test provided relief of segmental and radiating pain bilaterally, greater on the right, at C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1. Maximum foraminal compression bilaterally caused pain rated 6 out of 10, greater on the right, at C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1 with radiation. Shoulder depression test bilaterally produced pain rated 6 out of 10, more intense on the right at the same levels, with local radiating pain. Percussion with an instrument caused pain in the mid and upper thoracic regions. Costoclavicular maneuver showed no change in radial pulse bilaterally. The claimant exhibited spinal restrictions and subluxations at the occiput, cervical levels C1, C2, C5, C6, and C7, and thoracic levels T1, T4, T5, T6, T7, and T8. Extraspinal restrictions were noted in the left and right scapulae and the right shoulder. Pain and tenderness were present in the mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, upper thoracic, and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis revealed forward head flexion, thoracic hyperkyphosis, and rounded shoulders. Muscle spasms were rated 3 out of 10 in the anterior head, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, posterior head, left side of the neck, left trapezius, right posterior shoulder, and left mid thoracic tissue tone. Muscle spasms rated 4 out of 10 were found in the right anterior trapezius, right side of the neck, right posterior trapezius, right mid thoracic, and right lower thoracic tissue tone. Range of motion was moderately reduced throughout the entire cervical spine with mild pain noted. Thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation were also moderately reduced with mild stiffness and pain. Right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation were not reduced but exhibited mild stiffness, particularly during abduction coupled with internal rotation. Based on her history and examination, it was reasonable to believe that her recovery may take longer than an average patient with an uncomplicated case. The claimant tolerated cervical spine passive range of motion stretching well. Treatment was rendered without incident and she was responding as expected. The treatment diagnosis was strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level; Other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 levels; Other muscle spasm; Car occupant injured in other specified transport accidents; Muscle spasm of back; Other specified dorsopathies, thoracic region; Concussion without loss of consciousness.

Plan: The treatment plan included laser stimulation was applied for 8 minutes at 500-5000 Hz to the right lower cervical spine and upper shoulder regions (right side more than left), and for 2 minutes at 5000 Hz to the C5-C7 facets. As per the treatment plan, a hot moist pack was applied to the posterior cervical (neck) region for 10 minutes. Y-Axis mechanical traction was administered to the mid to lower cervical spine for 10 minutes using 9 pounds of force at 20 degrees of flexion. Passive and active stretching were performed for 15 minutes targeting the cervical spine range of motion and muscles including the suboccipitals, sternocleidomastoids, levators, upper trapezius, scalenes, and splenius. Scapulothoracic mobilizations focused on retraction and circumduction, along with right shoulder passive range of motion exercises. Manipulation of extremity joints, specifically the right shoulder and bilateral scapulothoracic joints, was performed using mobilization techniques and gentle thrusts within patient tolerance. Chiropractic manipulation was applied to the mid and upper thoracic spine using low force techniques such as Activator and drop methods, resulting in small cavitations at the mid thoracic spine. The rationale for therapy included improving balance, single-leg stance, and endurance; increasing time between visits; reducing pain; enhancing range of motion; and decreasing recurrences. Treatment was rendered without incident, and the claimant responded as expected. The claimant was advised to continue with the treatment plan as scheduled for the next visit.

HPI: The claimant reported being definitely sore after her last visit, leading her to refrain from exercising for a couple of days due to achiness and soreness in her neck and shoulders, along with some arm and hand weakness. These symptoms subsided, and she noted improvement by the third day. She also experienced a severe headache triggered by very rainy weather, which was atypical for her since the motor vehicle accident.

Exam: The claimant demonstrated some improvement in cervical spine paraspinal muscle tone and right upper trapezius tenderness. Daily objective findings revealed spinal restrictions and subluxations at the occiput, cervical levels C1, C2, C5, C6, and C7, and thoracic levels T1, T2, T4, T5, T6, T7, and T8. Extraspinal restrictions were noted in the left and right scapulae and the right shoulder. Pain and tenderness were present from the upper to mid cervical, mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, upper thoracic, and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis showed forward head flexion, thoracic hyperkyphosis, and rounded shoulders. Muscle spasms rated 4 out of 10 were observed in the posterior head, left mid thoracic, left lower thoracic, anterior head, right posterior shoulder, right anterior shoulder, left trapezius, and left anterior trapezius tissue tone. More severe spasms, rated 5 out of 10, were noted in the right anterior trapezius, left and right sides of the neck, right posterior trapezius, right mid thoracic, and right lower thoracic tissue tone. Range of motion throughout the entire cervical spine was moderately reduced with moderate pain. Thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation were moderately reduced with mild to moderate pain. Right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation were mildly reduced with mild tightness and stiffness. The claimant demonstrated slight improvement as indicated in today's subjective and objective evaluations. The determination of care was that continued treatment remained necessary. The claimant had experienced the current episode for longer than one month, with positive MRI findings and a severe initial injury episode. She also delayed seeking treatment for more than seven days. No contraindications to chiropractic treatment were noted.

HPI: The claimant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11/15/2019. The claimant reported continuing self-care by performing physical therapy exercises at home, including stretching, aerobic exercise, and efforts to improve stamina, balance, and flexibility. She experienced throbbing headaches, primarily at the top of the head and right orbital area, triggered by excessive exertion; these headaches were relieved by Advil. Neck pain was aggravated by exercise. Referral symptoms included tingling in the right scapular area, shoulder, and upper arm, which returned when headaches and neck pain worsened. The claimant remained off work with no set return date. She had seen a concussion specialist and planned to follow up with physiatry, attending monthly visits. She had recently failed a balance test, and vision testing indicated persistent lack of convergence. Her past medical history included severe allergies, though she had not traveled recently and reported no fever or illness exposure. During the acute/active care visit #12 of a projected 24 visits, the chief complaint included aching, burning, dullness, stiffness, tightness, and tingling discomfort in the anterior head, bilateral anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, bilateral sides of the neck, left trapezius, upper thoracic region, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right triceps, mid thoracic, right mid thoracic, and right lower thoracic areas. The claimant reported that this complaint had returned since the last visit. Activities of daily living such as homemaking, lifting, personal care (washing, dressing, etc.), sleeping, traveling or driving, and walking had worsened. Current functional deficits included difficulties caring for family, concentrating, driving, exercising, falling asleep, grocery shopping, performing household chores, lifting objects, looking over the shoulder, reaching overhead, showering or bathing, staying asleep, and using a computer. The claimant rated the discomfort level since the last encounter at its worst as 6 out of 10 on a verbal or visual analog scale. 

Exam: The claimant's cervical spine range of motion was measured as 45 degrees flexion, 36 degrees extension, 20 degrees left lateral flexion, 28 degrees right lateral flexion, 60 degrees left rotation, and 64 degrees right rotation, with pain noted mainly in left lateral flexion and left rotation causing shooting pain down the right side. Grip strength was 60 on the right and 54 on the left. Weakness was noted in the trapezius, deltoid, and triceps muscles. Facet compression testing was positive bilaterally, with right greater than left lower cervical spine pain radiating down to the upper thoracic/costovertebral joints. Neurological and mental status evaluations showed the patient was alert, oriented to person, place, and time, and cooperative. Sensory testing bilaterally revealed normal dermatomal findings at all upper spinal segments for pain, gross touch, vibration, and light touch sensations. Upper extremity resistive isometric motor testing was normal (5/5) except for slight weakness on the left side: shoulder elevation (left 4+/5, right 5/5), deltoid (left 4+/5, right 5/5), biceps (both sides 5/5), and triceps (left 4+/5, right 5/5). Deep tendon reflexes were diminished bilaterally (1+) in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis. Orthopedic testing included Kemp’s test bilaterally, which elicited segmental pain rated 5 out of 10 at T2 through T7 without radiation. Distraction test provided relief of segmental and radiating pain bilaterally, greater on the right at C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1 levels. Orthopedic testing revealed the following findings: Kemp’s test performed bilaterally elicited segmental pain rated 5 out of 10 at T2 through T7 levels without radiation. Distraction test provided relief of segmental and radiating pain bilaterally, greater on the right at C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1. Maximum foraminal compression bilaterally caused pain rated 6 out of 10, more pronounced on the right, at C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1 with radiation. Shoulder depression test bilaterally produced pain rated 6 out of 10, greater on the right at the same cervical levels, with local radiating pain. Percussion with an instrument elicited pain in the mid and upper thoracic regions. Costoclavicular maneuver showed no change in radial pulse bilaterally. Daily objective findings revealed spinal restrictions and subluxations at the occiput, cervical levels C1, C2, C5, C6, and C7, and thoracic levels T1, T2, T4, T5, T6, T7, and T8. Extraspinal restrictions were noted in the left and right scapulae and the right shoulder. Pain and tenderness were present in the upper to mid cervical, mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, upper thoracic, and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis demonstrated forward head flexion, thoracic hyperkyphosis, and rounded shoulders. Muscle spasms rated 4 out of 10 were observed in the posterior head, left mid thoracic, left lower thoracic, anterior head, right posterior shoulder, right anterior shoulder, left trapezius, and left anterior trapezius tissue tone. More severe spasms rated 6 out of 10 were present in the right anterior trapezius, left and right sides of the neck, right posterior trapezius, right mid thoracic, and right lower thoracic tissue tone. Range of motion throughout the entire cervical spine was moderately reduced with moderate pain. Thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation were moderately reduced with mild to moderate pain. Right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation were mildly reduced with mild tightness and stiffness. Based on the history and examination, it was reasonable to believe that recovery may take longer than an average patient with an uncomplicated case. The claimant had duration of current episode longer than 1 month, positive MRI findings, severity of initial episode of injury, and waited more than 7 days to seek treatment. Treatment diagnoses included: Strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level; Other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 levels; Muscle spasm of back; Other specified dorsopathies, thoracic region; and Concussion without loss of consciousness.

Her neck and upper shoulders were ""on fire"" and tingling, with pain when trying to turn her head, lift things, reach for things, clean, and sleep. She reported constant aching, burning, dull, stiffness, tightness and tingling discomfort in the cervical and upper thoracic regions, radiating to the left lower arm, right shoulder and left lower arm. Pain was rated 7/10. She had difficulty with most daily activities. She experienced nausea when trying to exercise. Sleep was disrupted due to discomfort. On 04/11/2022, claimant presented for her second visit out of a projected four visits for acute/active care treatment. She reported dull, aching, and burning discomfort affecting multiple areas including the right and left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, posterior head, left and right sides of the neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right triceps, right posterior elbow, right posterior forearm, and right mid thoracic region. Since the last visit, claimant stated that her symptoms had improved. She noted improvements in activities of daily living such as homemaking, lifting, sleeping, and traveling/driving. Despite this progress, she continued to experience functional deficits impacting caring for family, concentration, driving, exercising, sleeping, performing household chores, lifting, looking over her shoulder, reaching overhead, sitting, staying asleep, computer use, and yard work. Her discomfort level since the last encounter was rated intermittently at 5 out of 10 on a verbal or visual analog scale.

Exam: The claimant presented with spinal restrictions/subluxations at C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7 and T8, as well as extraspinal restrictions/subluxations in the left scapula, right scapula and right shoulder. Pain and tenderness were noted in the mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, upper thoracic and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis revealed forward head flexion and thoracic hyper kyphosis with rounded shoulders. Muscle spasms rated 4/10 were observed in the anterior head, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, posterior head, left side of neck, left trapezius, right posterior shoulder, left mid thoracic and right lower thoracic areas. Muscle spasms rated 5/10 were noted in the right anterior trapezius, right side of neck, right posterior trapezius and right mid thoracic areas. Cervical range of motion testing showed moderately reduced extension, left rotation, left lateral flexion and right lateral flexion with mild to moderate pain. Thoracic range of motion was moderately reduced in flexion, extension and bilateral rotation with mild stiffness and pain. Right shoulder abduction, flexion and internal rotation were not reduced but mild stiffness was noted, mainly in abduction coupled with internal rotation. Treatment diagnoses included other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 levels, other muscle spasm, segmental and somatic dysfunction of thoracic region, other specified dorsopathies of thoracic region, and pain in right and left hip. Assessment revealed the following, based on her history and examination, it was reasonable to believe that her recovery may take longer than an average with an uncomplicated case. The claimant tolerated cervical spine passive ROM stretching pretty well with little upper extremity referral or spasming noted. Treatment was rendered without incident and the claimant related improvement after treatment.

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals. 

Plan: The treatment plan included drop table and mechanical or instrument-assisted chiropractic manipulative treatment (CMT) to the cervical dorsal spinal region, lumbar spinal region, lumbosacral spinal region, cervical spinal region and right shoulder at a frequency of 2 visits per week for 6 weeks, followed by a re-exam within 42 days. The plan also included hot moist pack applied to posterior cervical region for 10 minutes and Y-axis mechanical traction applied to mid to lower cervical for 8 minutes with 9lbs in 20 degrees of flexion. Laser treatment, passive and active stretching of cervical spine, scapulothoracic mobilizations, and right shoulder passive range of motion exercises were performed. Manipulation of extremity joints and chiropractic manipulation using low force techniques were also conducted. The claimant was instructed in home care recommendations including home hot pack application and ice for 20 minutes for pain. Short-term goals included increasing ability to perform daily activities within 42 days. The long-term goal was to attain pre-condition/pre-injury status. Treatment effectiveness was to be evaluated using functional outcome assessment tools including the Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale Questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and Neck Pain Disability Index Questionnaire, with a goal score of 10% or better.

HPI: The claimant reported having lower left back clicking and achy pain for a couple of months. The neck was always an issue, more on the right side. The claimant experienced tingling around the left lower lumbar spine. The claimant was unsure what made it better, but mentioned Advil helped. It was made worse by exercise, twisting, and quick movements. The claimant denied any referred pain or trauma. For the hip, the claimant had previously tried acupuncture, massage, medications, and testing. The claimant had prior chiropractic treatment at this office a year ago. The claimant worked in real estate, which involved driving a lot and going to an office in Allentown 1-2 times per week. The claimant reported right cervical dorsal dull, aching, burning, tightness/stiffness, sore or bruised feeling, and throbbing discomfort. The claimant stated this complaint had returned since the last visit. The claimant's discomfort level for this complaint since the last encounter, at its worst, was rated 5/10 using a Verbal or Visual Analog Scale 51-75% of the day. 

Exam: The claimant exhibited slow but not guarded or grossly abnormal gait. Posture was rounded and non-antalgic. Standing trunk range of motion showed left flexion and right rotation as most painful. Hip range of motion was limited with pain mainly in adduction. Single leg stance was fine. Squat was fine. Muscle tension, palpatory tenderness, and segmental restrictions were most prominent at lower cervical spine to upper thoracic muscles bilaterally, and L2-3 and left sacroiliac joint. Post shear and Patrick's test caused some left anterior hip pain and left quadratus lumborum pain. Hip compressive testing elicited pain in lower back, with the right side not as severe. Neurological examination showed the claimant was alert and oriented x3. Dermatomal sensory testing was normal at all upper and lower spinal segments. Gross touch, vibration, and light touch sensations were within normal limits at all upper and lower spinal segments. Deep tendon reflexes were 1/5 at biceps, brachioradialis, patella, and Achilles bilaterally. Cervical facet compressive testing was positive bilaterally in the lower cervical spine without radiation. Shoulder depression test elicited 5/10 pain bilaterally at C6/C7 and C5/C6 with non-radiating local pain. Distraction test was negative bilaterally. Soto-Hall test was negative. Straight leg raise test elicited 5/10 pain in the bilateral sacroiliac joint and sciatic notch to thigh at 70 degrees. Kemp's test elicited 5/10 segmental pain at left pelvis, left sacrum, L2, and L3 without radiation. Iliac compression test elicited 5/10 sacroiliac joint pain bilaterally, greater on the left. Minor's sign was within normal limits. Yeoman's test elicited 5/10 sacroiliac joint pain bilaterally, greater on the left. FABERE/Patrick's test elicited 5/10 pain in bilateral hip joints, greater on the left. Spinal restrictions/subluxations were noted at C5, C6, left pelvis, left sacrum, L2, L3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, C7, and T1. Extraspinal restrictions/subluxations were noted in bilateral hips. Pain/tenderness was noted in cervicothoracic, mid to lower cervical, lower lumbar, lumbosacral, sacral, and hip regions. Postural analysis revealed forward flexed head and rounded shoulders. Muscle spasms rated 5/10 were noted in left lumbar, left sacroiliac, left buttock, right lumbar, right sacroiliac, and left anterior hip tissues. Muscle spasms rated 4/10 were noted in bilateral sides of neck, bilateral cervical dorsal, bilateral mid thoracic, and bilateral upper shoulder regions. Cervical extension, rotation, and lateral flexion were mildly to moderately reduced with mild to moderate pain. Lumbar extension, right rotation, and left lateral flexion were mildly to moderately reduced with mild to moderate pain. Treatment diagnoses included other specified dorsopathies of lumbar region, segmental and somatic dysfunction of sacral region, muscle spasm of back, other cervical disc degeneration at C5-C6 and C6-C7 levels, segmental and somatic dysfunction of thoracic region, and pain in bilateral hips. Assessment revealed the following, based on the history and examination, it was reasonable to believe that recovery may take longer than an average case with uncomplicated factors. The claimant had duration of current episode longer than 1 month, positive MRI findings, severity of initial episode of injury, and waited more than 7 days to seek treatment. These factors suggested the recovery may be prolonged.

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals.  

Plan: The treatment plan included hot moist pack applied to mid thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions for 10 minutes. Unattended interferential EMS was applied to left cervical dorsal, right cervical dorsal, left sacroiliac, and right sacroiliac regions for 10 minutes.

HPI: The claimant presented with lower left back pain and excruciating psoas pain. She was hoping cold laser treatment would help, as she had success with it on her neck previously. The claimant had to quit Jazzercise over a month ago due to the pain. She had cortisone shots in both hips in January, which helped but she thought the effects had worn off. The pain was located in the anterior groin, shooting down to the knees, not so much in the lateral hips. Pain worsened with walking, stairs, and sleep was agonizing. Barre exercises felt amazing afterwards. The onset was a month ago. The claimant reported no menstrual issues, but bowels seemed to have slowed down. She also noted her lower left back was sore. 

Exam: The claimant exhibited a seated posture sliding her buttocks forward and slouching to avoid sitting with hips bent. Left thigh extension and psoas resistance were more painful than the right. Posterior shear and Patrick's test were very painful. Left lower LS facets, psm and SIJ were more tender and restricted. Gait was slow but not guarded or grossly abnormal. Posture was rounded and non-antalgic. Standing trunk range of motion showed left lateral flexion and extension were most painful across left lower back and bilateral anterior hips. Hip range of motion was limited with pain mainly in adduction and flexion, as well as external rotation. Muscle tension, palpatory tenderness and segmental restrictions were most prominent at lower LS L2-3 and left SIJ. Post shear and Patrick's test caused left anterior hip pain and left QL pain. Hip compressive testing caused lower back pain. Neuro-mental status evaluations showed the claimant was alert and oriented x3. Neuro-sensory-pain evaluations revealed normal dermatomal findings at all upper and lower spinal segments. Gross touch, vibration, and light touch sensations were within normal limits at all upper and lower spinal segments. Straight Leg Raise test indicated 5/10 pain bilaterally in the sacro-iliac joint and sciatic notch to thigh at 70 degrees. Kemp's test revealed 5/10 segmental level pain at left pelvis, left sacrum, L2, and L3 without radiation. Iliac Compression test showed increased S.I. joint pain of 5/10 bilaterally, greater on the left. Minor's Sign was within normal limits. Yeoman's test indicated increased S.I. joint pain of 5/10 bilaterally, greater on the left. FABERE/Patrick's test revealed 5/10 pain bilaterally in the hip joints, greater on the left. Spinal restrictions/subluxations were noted at left pelvis, left sacrum, L2, L3, and left L5. Extraspinal restrictions/subluxations were noted in left and right hips. Pain/tenderness was present in lower lumbar, lumbo-sacral, sacral, hip, and upper leg regions. Postural analysis showed forward flexed head and rounded shoulders. Muscle spasms rated 7/10 were noted in left lumbar, left sacroiliac, left buttock, left anterior hip, left anterior leg, and left posterior hip tissues. Muscle spasms rated 5/10 were noted in right lumbar, right sacroiliac, right buttock, right posterior hip, right anterior hip, and right anterior leg tissues. Hip flexion, internal rotation, and external rotation were mildly to moderately reduced with mild to moderate pain. Lumbar extension, right rotation, and left lateral flexion were mildly to moderately reduced with mild to moderate pain. Treatment diagnoses included intervertebral disc disorders with radiculopathy in lumbar region, segmental and somatic dysfunction of sacral region, muscle spasm of back, and pain in right and left hips. Assessment revealed the following, the chiropractor noted that based on the claimant's history and examination, it was reasonable to believe that recovery may take longer than an average with an uncomplicated case. Factors influencing this assessment included duration of current episode longer than 1 month, positive MRI findings, severity of initial episode of injury, and waiting more than 7 days to seek treatment. Does not seem to be an organic pathology. Improved for a brief time. 

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals. 

Plan: Claimant underwent a chiropractic evaluation including history taking, evaluation, assessment, and review of prior documentation. A significant, separately identifiable E&M service was performed, lasting 10-19 minutes, with the use of modifier 25 due to concurrent manipulation services. Treatment included, chiropractic manipulation performed to all regions based on clinical findings, utilizing low force techniques (Activator, Drops) to the upper cervical spine and mid/upper thoracic spine, with cavitations noted at mid thoracic spine. Side lying lumbar/sacral spinal manipulation with some bilateral movement, especially on the left side with a ""pull"" sensation. Laser therapy consisting of a quarter laser package (1 of 4), low level laser package (4 treatments), including 5 minutes of laser pain control to the left lower lumbar-sacral area and 5 minutes each side to the left and right anterolateral hip. Hot moist packs applied to mid thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions for 10 minutes. Mechanical flexion/distraction traction without chiropractic manipulation therapy applied to lower lumbar and lumbo-sacral regions for 5 minutes. Laser stimulation for 8 minutes at 500-5000 Hz to right more than left lower cervical spine and upper shoulder regions, and 2 minutes at 5000 Hz to C5-7 facets. Unattended interferential electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) applied to left sacroiliac, left lumbar, and left buttock regions for 10 minutes. Prior exercises were reviewed, including chin tucks, side raises, and demonstrated pectoral Y/T stretching with ice application to the pectoral and neck areas several times daily. Claimant tolerated the treatments well, exited the office without incident, and was advised to return as soon as possible for follow-up.

HPI: The claimant felt like laser treatment the other day may have loosened things up a little bit but she was still definitely in pain. She felt basically like she was in the same spot, except hadn't been up during the night very recently in pain. The claimant felt like some tingling was moving up to the LS psm. 

Exam: Assessment revealed the following, claimant was treated with laser therapy throughout the anterolateral hips and left lower lumbar spine. Daily assessments indicated brief improvements based on subjective and objective evaluations. Continued care was deemed necessary. Consideration was given to ordering an MRI of the lumbar spine and follow-up with Dr. Armad to determine if imaging could be authorized, noting that the claimant had previously tried chiropractic care for approval. It was observed that it did not appear to be an organic pathology, directing focus towards lumbar spine and sacral regions. Exercise recommendations included discontinuing Jazzercise for two weeks and substituting with swimming, which was considered a suitable whole-body workout. The claimant was very committed to Jazzercise, having participated for 15 years, and regarded it as the most convenient and effective exercise. Lumbar spine and sacral X-rays with flexion-extension views were ordered to rule out instability or spondylolisthesis. Radiographs from St. Luke’s showed mild anterior spurring at T12 with mild chronic anterior height loss, mild anterior spurring at L1-L3, no instability on bending views, and intact pedicles. Diagnoses included intervertebral disc disorders with radiculopathy of the lumbar region, segmental and somatic dysfunction of the sacral region, muscle spasm of the back and bilateral hip pain. Overall, claimant was assessed to be in fair health, expected to make fair progress and recovery with minimal residuals. Factors such as episode duration exceeding one month, multiple prior episodes, employment nature, exacerbations, osteoarthritis, positive MRI findings, delayed treatment initiation, and claimant compliance were considered. No contraindications to chiropractic care were identified. Recovery was anticipated to take longer than average for an uncomplicated case.

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals. 

Plan: The treatment plan included laser therapy in laser slot 4 for pain control, with 5 minutes applied to the left lower lumbar spine and 5 minutes to each side of the anterolateral hip. The chiropractor advised the claimant to return as soon as possible. Prior treatments mentioned included hot moist pack application to mid thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions for 10 minutes, mechanical flexion/distraction traction without chiropractic manipulative therapy applied to lower lumbar and lumbo-sacral regions for 5 minutes, and chiropractic manipulation using low force techniques to the upper cervical spine and mid/upper thoracic spine. Unattended interferential electrical muscle stimulation was previously applied to left sacroiliac, left lumbar, and left buttock regions for 10 minutes. The chiropractor previously demonstrated chin tucks, side raises, and pectoral Y/T stretching exercises. The claimant was instructed to ice the pectoral area and neck several times a day. A follow-up appointment was planned for one week later.

HPI: The claimant stated she felt like immediately after laser treatment things were ""loosened up"" somewhat, but pain still persisted and the ""loosening"" went away shortly after treatment. She reported tingling that was now more ""warm and burning-ish"". She also reported being out of breath with walking regularly. The claimant was not aware of other joints hurting. She mentioned her sister had some rheumatic condition. The claimant stated she was tested by a rheumatologist years ago and all tests were negative. 

Exam: Assessment revealed the following, claimant was assessed and found to be in fair health with a history of multiple prior episodes related to lumbar and hip pain. The current episode had lasted longer than one month. Examination revealed intervertebral disc disorders with radiculopathy in the lumbar region, segmental and somatic dysfunction of the sacral region, muscle spasms in the back, and bilateral hip pain. Imaging showed mild anterior spurring and chronic changes in the thoracolumbar spine without instability. It was noted that menopause-related lower estrogen levels contribute to reduced collagen production, resulting in weaker, thinner tendons and faster tendon deterioration, which may exacerbate hip pain by impairing tendon repair. Claimant demonstrated some brief improvement per subjective and objective evaluations. Given her history, clinical findings, and imaging results, it was determined that continued care was necessary. Chiropractic treatment was deemed appropriate with no contraindications noted. The claimant was advised to discontinue Jazzercise for two weeks and to consider swimming as a suitable alternative for whole-body exercise. Further investigations including lumbar spine and sacral X-rays with flexion-extension views were ordered to rule out instability or spondylolisthesis. Follow-up with Dr. Armad regarding MRI ordering was planned. Overall, claimant's recovery was expected to be slower than average due to the chronicity, prior episodes, osteoarthritis, and positive MRI findings. She remained compliant with treatment recommendations.

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals. 

Plan: The treatment plan included laser therapy 3/4, with 5 minutes applied to the left lower lumbar spine and 5 minutes to each side of the left and right anterolateral hip. The chiropractor advised discontinuing Jazzercise for 2 weeks and recommended swimming as a replacement exercise. Lumbar spine and sacral x-rays with flexion-extension views were ordered to rule out instability/spondylolisthesis. The plan included continued care as necessary. The claimant was to return as soon as possible for the next visit. Previous treatments mentioned included hot pack application, mechanical flexion/distraction traction, chiropractic manipulation using low force techniques, and electrical muscle stimulation.

HPI: The claimant stated that an orthopedist thought her hip pain was related to her T12-L3 area. She had been prescribed Prednisone and an MRI of the lumbar spine was ordered. The claimant was referred to a physiatrist and physical therapy. Cortisone shots in the psoas were offered. The claimant's ESR was 9 and CRP was 1.5. 

Exam: Assessment revealed the following, the claimant underwent physical therapy and MRI evaluations, with plans to follow up afterward. The spine was not considered the primary source of symptoms, as the bilateral complaints were more consistent with inflammatory or soft tissue issues rather than nerve-related problems. There was an understanding that menopause-related decreased estrogen levels contribute to reduced collagen production, resulting in weaker tendons and faster tendon deterioration, which may be linked to her hip pain. The claimant showed brief improvement according to subjective and objective assessments. Continued care was deemed necessary, including consideration for lumbar spine MRI pending approval from Dr. Armad, especially after chiropractic treatment was trialed. Laser therapy was planned for four sessions. Given the lack of evidence for organic pathology, focus was directed toward the lumbar spine and sacral regions. Recommendations included discontinuing Jazzercise for two weeks, with swimming suggested as a preferable full-body workout alternative. Lumbar spine and sacral X-rays with flexion and extension views were ordered to rule out instability or spondylolisthesis. Imaging revealed mild chronic anterior spurring at T12 and L1-3, with no instability on bending views and intact pedicles. Diagnoses included lumbar intervertebral disc disorder with radiculopathy, segmental and somatic dysfunction of the sacral region, back muscle spasm, and bilateral hip pain. The claimant was assessed to be in fair health, expected to make fair progress with some residual symptoms. Based on the claimant's history and examination, it was reasonable to believe that recovery may take longer than an average case with an uncomplicated presentation. The claimant had a duration of current episode longer than 1 month, positive MRI findings, severity of initial episode of injury, and waited more than 7 days to seek treatment.

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals. 

Plan: The treatment plan included laser therapy 4/4, with 5 minutes applied to the left lower lumbar spine and 5 minutes to each side of the anterolateral hip. The chiropractor advised the claimant to return on an ""as needed"" basis. Previous treatments mentioned included hot packs, mechanical flexion/distraction traction, chiropractic manipulation using low force techniques, and electrical muscle stimulation. The chiropractor had previously demonstrated pectoral Y/T stretching and instructed the claimant to ice the pectoral area and neck several times a day. The plan also included discontinuing Jazzercise for 2 weeks, with swimming recommended as a replacement exercise. X-rays of the lumbar spine and sacrum with flexion-extension views were to be ordered to rule out instability/spondylolisthesis. An ultrasound of the lower quadrants was being considered. The chiropractor noted that continued care was necessary.

HPI: HPI: The claimant presented with anterior groin pain radiating down to the knees, which began approximately one month ago. She had been seeing a chiropractor in Allentown for mechanical traction, which she found more helpful than initially expected, though she noted increased pain after a few weeks without it. She was scheduled for a medial branch block but expressed nervousness about the procedure and sought conservative management options. A previous course of Prednisone significantly improved her symptoms, suggesting a strong inflammatory component. Her orthopedic evaluation linked her hip pain to the T12-L3 region. She had cortisone injections in both hips in January that provided temporary relief, but the pain later returned. The pain worsened with walking, climbing stairs, and sleep, but improved following Barre exercises involving isometric holds and light weights. She experienced tingling described as warm and burning, which seemed to be ascending toward the lumbar paraspinal muscles. She also reported increased shortness of breath with regular walking. The claimant had to discontinue Jazzercise due to pain and had tried Trager therapy without significant benefit to her hips or hip flexors. Meloxicam was ineffective. She denied other joint pain but noted some lower left back soreness. Past history included a uterine ablation, with ongoing hormone testing. Family history was positive for a rheumatic condition in her sister. Previous rheumatologic workup years ago was negative. Laboratory tests showed ESR of 9 and CRP of 1.5. An MRI of the lumbar spine was ordered, and referrals to a physiatrist and physical therapy were planned. Cortisone injections into the psoas were offered. The claimant felt temporary relief after laser treatments but persistent pain remained.

Exam: The claimant demonstrated a seated posture with forward sliding of the buttocks and slouching to avoid hip flexion. Left thigh extension and psoas resistance were more painful than the right. Posterior shear and Patrick's test caused significant pain. Left lower lumbar spine facets, paraspinal muscles, and sacroiliac joint were more tender and restricted. Gait was slow but not guarded or grossly abnormal. Posture was rounded and non-antalgic. Standing trunk range of motion showed left lateral flexion and extension were most painful, across the left lower back and bilateral anterior hips. Hip range of motion was limited with pain mainly in adduction and flexion, as well as external rotation. Muscle tension, palpatory tenderness, and segmental restrictions were most prominent at lower lumbar spine L2-3 and left sacroiliac joint. Straight leg raise test indicated 5/10 pain bilaterally in the sacroiliac joint and sciatic notch to thigh at 70 degrees. Kemp's test revealed 5/10 segmental level pain at left pelvis, left sacrum, L2, and L3 without radiation. Iliac compression test showed increased sacroiliac joint pain of 5/10 bilaterally, greater on the left. Yeoman's test indicated increased sacroiliac joint pain of 5/10 bilaterally, greater on the left. FABERE/Patrick's test revealed 5/10 pain bilaterally in the hip joint, greater on the left. Spinal restrictions/subluxations were noted at left pelvis, left sacrum, L2, L3, and left L5. Extraspinal restrictions/subluxations were noted in bilateral hips. Muscle spasms were rated 7/10 in left lumbar, left sacroiliac, left buttock, left anterior hip, left anterior leg, and left posterior hip tissue, and 5/10 in the corresponding right-sided areas. Range of motion for hip flexion, internal rotation, and external rotation was recorded as mild/moderate reduced with mild/moderate pain. Lumbar extension, right rotation, and left lateral flexion were also recorded as mild/moderate reduced with mild/moderate pain. Treatment diagnoses included intervertebral disc disorders with radiculopathy in the lumbar region, segmental and somatic dysfunction of the sacral region, muscle spasm of the back, and pain in right and left hips. Assessment as follows, on 12-21-24, the claimant was very desperate for relief from any useful source but was uncertain about the risk/benefit ratio of the scheduled block. The relative minor chances of negative consequences were discussed, emphasizing that the block would be more diagnostic than therapeutic and should provide clarification. The claimant was advised to try an anti-inflammatory diet, considering the beneficial effects of Prednisone, while avoiding reliance on prescription or over-the-counter medications. The claimant planned to undergo physical therapy (PT) and MRI, with follow-up to be determined after those assessments. It was assessed that the spine was unlikely the primary issue, as symptoms were bilateral and inflammatory/soft tissue in nature rather than nerve-type. The link between menopause and hip pain was reviewed, noting that decreased estrogen levels reduce collagen production, leading to weaker and thinner tendons and accelerated tendon deterioration. Estrogen’s role in collagen synthesis affects tendon repair and maintenance, explaining the patient's symptoms. Daily assessment indicated brief improvement based on subjective and objective evaluations. Determination of care included continued treatment, with plans to order lumbar spine MRI pending approval from Dr. Armad, noting prior chiropractic treatment was attempted. Four sessions of laser therapy were recommended. Since no organic pathology was evident, attention was directed toward lumbar sacral/sacroiliac (LS/S) regions. Recommendations included discontinuing Jazzercise for two weeks, although the claimant was very committed to it as her preferred workout for 15 years. Swimming was suggested as a suitable alternative for whole-body exercise, and barre was considered acceptable. Lumbar spine and sacral X-rays with flexion and extension views were ordered to rule out instability or spondylolisthesis. Prior X-rays from St. Luke’s showed mild anterior spurring at T12 and L1-3 with mild chronic anterior height loss but no instability on bending views and intact pedicles. Overall, claimant was of fair health and expected to make fair progress and recovery with few residuals. The current episode had lasted longer than one month, with multiple prior episodes and exacerbations, osteoarthritis, positive MRI findings, and delayed treatment initiation (>7 days). Claimant compliance was noted, and no contraindications to chiropractic treatment were identified. Based on history and examination, her recovery was anticipated to take longer than average for an uncomplicated case.

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals. 

Plan: Claimant's Plans on 12/2/24 as follows, discussed her upcoming medial branch block and the role of anti-inflammatory treatments, integrating insights gained from various care approaches. Gentle flexion/distraction therapy was applied, based on her prior positive response to mechanical traction, along with soft tissue work and stretching within her tolerance. She appreciated the time spent discussing her care and left feeling more comfortable than at arrival. Laser therapy was administered for pain control: 5 minutes to the lower left lumbar-sacral area and 5 minutes to each anterolateral hip. Treatment included hot moist packs applied for 10 minutes to the mid thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions, followed by mechanical flexion/distraction traction to the lower lumbar and lumbo-sacral regions for 5 minutes without chiropractic manipulation. Low force chiropractic techniques (Activator, Drops) were performed on the upper cervical spine and mid/upper thoracic spine with gentle cavitations, along with sidelying lumbar-sacral/sacral work emphasizing movement bilaterally, especially on the left side. Prior laser stimulation and unattended interferential EMS were also part of the regimen. The claimant was instructed in chin tucks, side raises, and pec Y/T stretches with ice application to the pec and neck areas multiple times daily. She was advised to follow up on an as-needed basis and to keep the office updated as she progresses toward resolution. Treatment was rendered without incident, and the claimant exited the office without issues.

She reported right-sided neck pain radiating down the right posterior upper and lower arm to the hand, with some ""shooting"" pain up into the back of the neck and head on the right. Headaches were noted to be dependent on activity level and neck pain. The claimant stated this complaint had returned since the last visit. Chief complaints were anterior head, right anterior trapezius, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, left side of neck, right side of neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right triceps, right posterior elbow, right posterior forearm and right mid thoracic dull, aching and burning discomfort. She noted improved bilateral anterior hip pain, worsening lately, which was a recurrence from when she was pregnant. Pain was rated 6/10 at its worst since the last encounter. She reported worsening of homemaking, lifting, sleeping, and traveling/driving activities. Functional deficits included caring for family, concentrating, driving, exercising, getting to sleep, performing household chores, lifting objects, looking over shoulder, reaching overhead, sitting, staying asleep, using a computer, and participating in yard work. 

Exam: The claimant presented with a forward flexed head posture and thoracic hyperkyphosis with rounded shoulders. Cervical spine range of motion was 46-55P-27-25-58P-62 with pain mainly in Extension and LR of cervical spine. Grip strength was 57 lbs on the left and 49 lbs on the right with right pinky pain noted. Kemp's test elicited 5/10 segmental pain at T2-T7 without radiation. Distraction test provided relief of segmental and radiating pain at right C5-C6, C6-C7, and C7-T1. Maximum foraminal compression test caused 6/10 pain bilaterally, greater on the right at C5-C6, C6-C7, and C7-T1 with radiation. Shoulder depression test elicited 6/10 pain bilaterally, greater on the right at C5-C6, C6-C7, and C7-T1 with local and radiating pain. Percussion with an instrument caused pain in the mid and upper thoracic regions. Costoclavicular maneuver revealed no change in radial pulses bilaterally. Spinal restrictions were noted at C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T1-T8. Extraspinal restrictions were found in the left scapula, right scapula, and right shoulder. Pain and tenderness were present in the mid to lower cervical, cervicothoracic, upper thoracic, and mid-thoracic regions. Muscle spasms rated 4/10 were observed in the anterior head, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, posterior head, left side of neck, left trapezius, right posterior shoulder, and left mid-thoracic regions. Muscle spasms rated 6/10 were noted in the right anterior trapezius, right side of neck, right posterior trapezius, right mid-thoracic, and right lower thoracic regions. Cervical extension, left rotation, and bilateral lateral flexion were moderately reduced with mild pain. Thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation were moderately reduced with mild stiffness and pain. Right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation were not reduced but exhibited mild stiffness, mainly in abduction coupled with internal rotation. Treatment diagnoses were strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level init; Other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5; Other cervical disc degeneration at C5-C6 level; Other cervical disc degeneration at C6-C7; Other muscle spasm; Car occupant injured (driver) (passgenger) in other specified transport accidents initial encounter; Muscle spasm of back; Other specified dorsopathies, thoracic region; Concussion without loss of consciousness; Pain in right shoulder; Segmental and somatic dysfunction of upper extremity.  Based on her history and examination, it was reasonable to believe that her recovery may take longer than an average patient with an uncomplicated case. The claimant's progress was impacted by delays in care. She experienced regression with withdrawal of care but could manage symptoms at home for a few weeks to months before they slowly recurred. Treatment was rendered without incident and responding as expected.

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals.

Plan: The treatment plan included laser stimulation for 8 minutes at 500-5000 Hz to the right lower cervical spine and upper shoulder regions, and 2 minutes at 5000 Hz to C5-7 facets. A hot moist pack was applied to the posterior cervical region for 10 minutes. Y-Axis mechanical traction was applied to the mid to lower cervical spine for 10 minutes with 9 lbs in 20 degrees of flexion. Passive and active stretching was performed for 15 minutes to the cervical spine, scapulothoracic, and right shoulder regions. Manipulation of the right shoulder and bilateral scapulothoracic joints was performed. Chiropractic manipulation using low force techniques was applied to the mid and upper thoracic spine. The claimant was advised to return as soon as possible. Short-term goals included increasing ability to perform activities of daily living within 42 days. The long-term goal was to attain pre-injury status. The treatment plan projected 12 to 18 visits of chiropractic manipulative treatment to the cervical, dorsal, lumbar, and lumbosacral spinal regions and right shoulder at a frequency of 2 visits per week for 6 weeks, followed by a re-exam within 42 days. Home care recommendations included using a hot pack and ice for pain management. The practitioner recommended the claimant to follow up next week, as she experienced a regression with withdrawal care.

She went to Patient First, received eye drops, and was advised to return to the ER for a CT scan. The claimant returned to the ER, believed she had a CT scan, and was discharged. She was then sent to a concussion doctor where she received physical therapy, occupational therapy, and vision therapy. She was also told to see an optometrist. The claimant reported developing tinnitus in both ears weeks after the accident, as well as burning in her eyes, photophobia, and pain behind her right eye. She experienced difficulty focusing with her right eye and felt her eyes were not working together. The claimant reported daily headaches after the accident, which reduced to twice a week by the time of examination. She also developed imbalance and cognitive dysfunction immediately after the accident. The claimant reported that her symptoms, except for tinnitus, began immediately after the accident. She was cleared to return to work two days prior to the examination. 

Medical Encounter: The physical examination revealed that the claimant was a pleasant-appearing woman in no acute distress. Her pupils were equal, round and reactive to light. Visual fields were full to confrontation. Extraocular movements were full with no nystagmus noted. There was normal pursuit, saccades and accommodation. The face was symmetric with normal sensation. The tongue and uvula were midline. There was normal bulk and tone with no abnormal movements. Strength was 5/5 in the arms and legs. The sensory examination was normal to all modalities. Coordination testing was normal. Her gait was narrow based. She was able to stand on her heels and toes and perform a deep knee bend. Romberg's sign was negative. She was able to tandem walk. Reflexes were ++ and symmetric. Hoffman's sign was negative and plantar responses were flexor. There was no tenderness to palpation over paraspinal muscles or the head. There was no palpable spasm or limited range of motion. There were no scars noted. 

Conclusions: The evaluator concluded that the claimant likely experienced a head contusion and post-traumatic headaches from the accident on 11/15/2019, but it was highly unlikely she had a concussion. Even if she did have a concussion, it would have been a self-limited injury with recovery expected within weeks to months. The evaluator stated that treating for 2-4 months was reasonable, but treatment beyond that was excessive. He found it unacceptable that the claimant was not given an expectation of full recovery within weeks to months following a minor head injury. The evaluator noted that musculoskeletal sprain and strain injuries were possible, which would also be self-limited with recovery expected in weeks to months. He deemed the claimant's complaints of pain and numbness throughout the entire right arm and hand to be non-physiologic. The evaluator concluded that the claimant had fully recovered from the accident as of the examination date. He determined that no additional diagnostics or treatments were indicated and the claimant had no restrictions whatsoever. 

Recommendations: Dr. Margolies concluded that the claimant had fully recovered from the accident that occurred on 11/15/2019. He stated that no additional diagnostics or treatments were indicated. He determined that the claimant had absolutely no restrictions whatsoever. Dr. Margolies opined that the claimant was likely to have experienced a head contusion and post-traumatic headaches, but thought it was highly unlikely she had a concussion. He noted that even if she had sustained a concussion, it would have been a self-limited injury with recovery expected in weeks to months with conservative measures. Dr. Margolies stated that treatment beyond 2-4 months was clearly excessive. "

HPI: The claimant reported no change in complaints. Lately, she reported symptoms were improved, but she continued to have a daily headache, which increased in intensity with eye exercises. The claimant's pain level prior to the session was 4/10 for headache and cervicalgia. She reported no medication changes since the last session. 

Exam: The claimant demonstrated increased treadmill intensity with speed increased to 2.6 MPH and incline to 3% during exercise, with heart rate monitoring increased to 107 bpm during the session, without symptom provocation. Vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) exercises were performed with increased intensity, including VOR-1 for 60 seconds, saccades and smooth pursuit for 60 seconds with far-field stimulation. Provocation of dizziness was noted with increased VOR-1 intensity, which resolved in 45-60 seconds. Single leg stance was performed with cognitive challenge (adding 7's, subtracting 4's), with continued good balance but some errors in math noted. BOSU challenges included head nods and VOR-CX (horizontal), with fatigue noted by the end of the exercise. Manual therapy to the thoracic spine (Grade III to IV) resulted in cavitation of T6, T5, and T4 with minimal pressure. Improved cervical mobility was reported following manual therapy. Balance testing showed improved balance with single leg stance. Treatment diagnoses confirmed during this visit included concussion with loss of consciousness of 30 minutes or less, subsequent encounter, and whiplash injury syndrome, subsequent encounter. Improved balance was noted with single leg stance, and improved cervical flexibility was observed after thoracic spine mobilizations. The claimant's compliance with therapy was good with consistent follow-through. The claimant demonstrated understanding of exercises and educational material presented. The therapist indicated continued skilled intervention was required for vestibular challenges, balance challenges with sensory integration, and cervical-thoracic mobility and strengthening. Progress toward current goals was demonstrated by program progression. 

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant showed fair response to treatment, with mild symptom provocation during vestibular exercises that relieved with rest. 

Plan: The treatment plan included continuing the current plan of care with a focus on program progression and increasing single-leg stance challenge with visual deprivation in the next session. During this visit, the claimant performed therapeutic exercises for 20 minutes, manual techniques for 10 minutes (targeting T-spine and cervical ribs), and neuromuscular re-education for 25 minutes (focusing on balance and vestibulocular exercises). The claimant tolerated increased treadmill intensity with speed increased to 2.6 MPH and incline to 3% during exercise, with heart rate monitoring. Vestibulocular exercises were performed with increased intensity, including VOR-1 for 60 seconds, saccades and smooth pursuits for 60 seconds with far-far-saccades. Manual techniques included T-spine mobilization (Grade III to IV) and first and second rib mobilization (Grade II to III), followed by self-mobilization exercises. The claimant's rehabilitation goals involved continued skilled intervention for vestibulocular challenges, balance challenges with sensory integration, cervical-thoracic mobility, and strengthening.

HPI: The claimant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11/15/2019. She was the driver of a large SUV when another vehicle pulled into her path, causing her to swerve into oncoming traffic and hit the other vehicle at an angle. The airbag deployed and hit her face, lacerating her eyebrow and causing her to lose consciousness for an unknown duration. She experienced right eye vision issues, headaches, neck and upper shoulder pain described as ""on fire"" and tingling, with pain when turning her head, lifting, reaching, cleaning, and sleeping. She reported constant aching, burning, dull, stiff, tight and tingling discomfort in multiple areas including her head, neck, shoulders, arms, and back. Pain was rated 7/10. She had difficulty with daily activities, work tasks, and exercise. On 01/23/2020, the claimant reported feeling the same with no improvement. Her primary symptoms were right-sided headache, eye strain, neck pain, and right scapular pain. 

Exam: The claimant presented with spinal restrictions/subluxations at occiput, C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, right T10, right T11 and right T12, as well as extraspinal restrictions at left scapula, right scapula and right shoulder. Pain and tenderness were noted in the upper to mid cervical, mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, upper thoracic and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis revealed forward head flexion and thoracic hyperkyphosis. Muscle spasms rated 4/10 were observed in the left anterior shoulder, posterior head, left posterior shoulder, left triceps, left mid thoracic and left lower thoracic. Spasms rated 6/10 were noted in the anterior head, right anterior trapezius, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, posterior head, left side of neck, right side of neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right mid thoracic, right lower thoracic and right lumbar regions. Range of motion in the entire cervical spine was moderately reduced with pain. Thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation were moderately reduced with pain. Right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation were mildly reduced with pain. Cervical spine ranges of motion were: flexion 40°, extension 42° with pain, left rotation 15°, right rotation 30°, left lateral flexion 55° with pain, right lateral flexion 60°. Grip strength measured 58 lbs on the right and 47 lbs on the left. Neurological testing revealed unremarkable diadochokinesia and finger-to-nose tests, with some difficulty noted in the left hand more than right. Cervical facet compression testing was positive with very limited range of motion and pain, right greater than left, without upper extremity referral. Upper extremity resistive isometric motor testing showed 4+/5 strength in left shoulder elevation, left deltoid, and left triceps, with 5/5 strength in all other tested muscle groups. Deep tendon reflexes were 1+ bilaterally for biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis. Kemp's test elicited 6/10 segmental pain at T2-T7 without radiation. Maximum foramina compression test produced 8/10 pain bilaterally, greater on the left at C5/C6, C7/T1 and C6/C7 with radiation. Treatment diagnoses included strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 levels, muscle spasm of back, other specified dorsopathies of thoracic region, concussion without loss of consciousness, pain in right shoulder, and segmental and somatic dysfunction of upper extremity.

She still experienced tingling in her right arm, though it was no longer burning. Her right shoulder had pain, with minimal symptoms on the left side. She rated her discomfort level at 5/10. The claimant reported improvements in headache intensity and frequency, as well as eye convergence. 

Exam: The claimant presented with spinal restrictions/subluxations at occiput, C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T1, T2, T4, T5, T6, T7 and T8, as well as extraspinal restrictions/subluxations at the left scapula, right scapula and right shoulder. Pain and tenderness were noted in the upper to mid cervical, mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, upper thoracic and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis revealed forward head flexion and thoracic hyperkyphosis. Muscle spasms were observed, rated 4/10 in the anterior head, posterior head, left mid thoracic and left lower thoracic, and 6/10 in the right anterior trapezius, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, left side of neck, right side of neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right mid thoracic, right lower thoracic and right lumbar regions. Range of motion in the entire cervical spine was moderately reduced with mild to moderate pain. Thoracic flexion, extension and bilateral rotation were moderately reduced with mild to moderate pain. Right shoulder abduction, flexion and internal rotation were mildly reduced with mild tightness and pain. Grip strength was measured at 50 on the right and 54 on the left. Orthopedic testing revealed positive Kemp's test at T2-T7 with segmental pain rated 6/10, negative Distraction test, positive Maximum Foramina Compression test at C5/C6, C7/T1 and C6/C7 with pain rated 8/10 and radiation bilaterally, negative Shoulder Depression test, and positive Percussion test in the mid and upper thoracic regions. Neurological testing showed reduced upper extremity motor strength (4+/5) in left shoulder elevation, left deltoid, and left triceps. Deep tendon reflexes were reduced (1+) bilaterally in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis. Sensory testing was within normal limits. The Neck Disability Index score was 60%. The Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale averaged 6.0, ranging from 4/10 to 7/10. Treatment diagnoses included strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 levels, muscle spasm of back, other specified dorsopathies of thoracic region, concussion without loss of consciousness, pain in right shoulder, and segmental and somatic dysfunction of upper extremity. Based on history and examination, it was reasonable to believe that recovery may take longer than an average patient with an uncomplicated case. The claimant had good tolerance for cervical spine manual and mechanical traction. Improvement was noted in ability to retract the right scapular from the ribcage with no increase in tingling. The claimant tolerated cervical spine passive range of motion stretching well, with little upper extremity referral or spasming noted. Treatment was rendered without incident and responding as expected. Diagnoses included Strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level; Other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 levels; Other muscle spasm; Car occupant injured in other specified transport accidents; Muscle spasm of back; Other specified dorsopathies, thoracic region; Concussion without loss of consciousness; Pain in right shoulder; Segmental and somatic dysfunction of upper extremity. 

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals. 

Plan: The treatment plan began on 01/09/2020 and is projected to be completed by an unknown date. The plan includes Drop Table and Mechanical or instrument-assisted Chiropractic Manipulative Treatment (CMT) to the cervical dorsal spinal region, lumbar spinal region, lumbosacral spinal region, cervical spinal region, and right shoulder. Treatment frequency is set at 2 visits per week for 6 weeks, followed by a re-exam within 42 days, with approximately 12 to 18 visits total. The claimant was instructed in home care recommendations that included home hot pack application and ice for 20 minutes for pain, to be repeated after 60 minutes and discontinued after 3 hours. The plan also includes chin tucks, side raises, and demonstration of Pec Y/T stretching. Treatment effectiveness will be evaluated using the Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale Questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and Neck Pain Disability Index Questionnaire. The short-term goal is to increase the claimant's ability to perform daily activities by the re-exam date within 42 days unless improvement warrants earlier discharge. The long-term goal is to attain pre-condition/pre-injury status. The functional outcome assessment tool goal score is set at 10% or better improvement.

HPI: The claimant had been on hold due to COVID-19 and reported experiencing a decline in functional status since that time. She noticed increased loss of balance, primarily to the left and forward with discussion. She denied problems with ambulation, except for very occasional loss of balance to the left. She had returned to her chiropractor, noting pain primarily in her right cervical spine, with some radiation down into the arm. She reported experiencing true vertigo about 2 weeks ago when lying down at night, most notable when lying on her right side, lasting less than 5 minutes but more than a minute. She continued to get radiating pain behind her right eye. The claimant had been doing aerobics (Jazzersize) through live streaming and performing some resistive exercises using 5-pound weights, which exacerbated her symptoms. Her current pain was reported as 6 out of 10 on the Visual Analog Pain Scale, with pain at best being 2 and at worst being 8. 

Exam: The claimant demonstrated decreased cervical motor control with absent smooth movements. Cervical range of motion measurements were: rotation right 0-50 degrees, left 0-56 degrees; lateral flexion right 0-22 degrees, left 0-26 degrees; flexion 0-24 degrees; extension 0-80 degrees. Increased muscle tension was noted over the bilateral upper trapezius, left cervical rib, upper and lower cervical paraspinals (right greater than left), bilateral upper thoracic paraspinals, and left anterior scalenes. Oculomotor testing revealed positive vertical saccadic pursuits, convergence of 12 cm with poor right eye control, positive hypometria vertically greater than horizontally with slow saccades, and blurry vision at all levels. Hallpike-Dix, Semont, and Roll tests were negative bilaterally. The Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance showed moderate increased sway with conditions 2 and 4. Functional Gait Assessment score was 28/30. The claimant was independent with bed mobility, supine to/from sit, and sit to/from stand transfers. No obvious gait deviations were observed. Treatment diagnoses included concussion with brief loss of consciousness, whiplash injury syndrome, and oculomotor apraxia.

She experienced vision issues, headaches, neck and upper shoulder pain described as ""on fire"" and tingling. She reported difficulty turning her head, lifting, reaching, cleaning, and sleeping. The claimant noted her right eye was ""not working right."" She had tried returning to work but struggled due to driving and laptop use requirements. On 06/04/2020, she reported last treatment was helpful but still had good and bad days for neck and scapular pain. Pain traveled from right lower neck to right medial upper scapula. Low grade headaches were ""always there."" She described her neck as ""firey and burny."" Pain scale was rated 5/10, present 25-33% of awake time. Activities of daily living including homemaking, lifting, personal care, sleeping, traveling/driving, and walking had improved. 

Exam: The claimant presented with forward flexed head posture and thoracic hyperkyphosis with rounded shoulders. Cervical spine range of motion was recorded as 40 degrees flexion, 42 degrees extension with pain, 15 degrees left lateral flexion, 30 degrees right lateral flexion, 55 degrees left rotation with pain, and 60 degrees right rotation. Grip strength measured 58 lbs on the right and 47 lbs on the left. Neuro testing revealed unremarkable diadochokinesia and finger-to-nose testing, with some difficulty noted left greater than right. Cervical facet compression testing was positive with very limited range of motion and pain right greater than left, but no upper extremity referral beyond the upper shoulder/upper trapezius region. Spinal restrictions/subluxations were noted at C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7 and T8. Extraspinal restrictions were found in the left scapula, right scapula and right shoulder. Pain and tenderness were observed in the mid to lower cervical, cervicothoracic, upper thoracic and mid-thoracic regions. Muscle spasms rated 3/10 were noted in the anterior head, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, posterior head, left side of neck, left trapezius, right posterior shoulder and left mid thoracic tissues. Muscle spasms rated 4/10 were observed in the right anterior trapezius, right side of neck, right posterior trapezius, right mid thoracic and right lower thoracic tissues. Thoracic range of motion was moderately reduced in flexion, extension and bilateral rotation with mild stiffness and pain. Right shoulder abduction, flexion and internal rotation were mildly reduced with mild stiffness. Kemp's test elicited 5/10 segmental pain at T2-T7 without radiation. Distraction test provided relief of segmental and radiating pain bilaterally, greater on the right at C5/C6, C6/C7 and C7/T1. Maximum foramina compression and shoulder depression tests produced 6/10 pain bilaterally, greater on the right at C5/C6, C6/C7 and C7/T1 with local and radiating pain. Percussion with instrument elicited pain in the mid and upper thoracic regions. Upper extremity resistive isometric motor testing revealed 4+/5 strength in left shoulder elevation, left deltoid, and left triceps, with 5/5 strength in all other tested muscle groups. Deep tendon reflexes were 1+ for biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis bilaterally. The Neck Disability Index score was 62%, with highest scores in headaches (5/5) and lifting (4/5). Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale average score was 6.0, ranging from 4/10 to 7/10.

HPI: The claimant reported having a long history of hip pain. She finally went to the doctor in 01/2024. Her pain increased and ""wrapped around to the front"" in 07/2024. She was given hip injections with little to no improvement. She was given a prednisone taper and had decreased hip pain. Now that her hip pain was feeling better, she was feeling a ""clicking"" sensation in her back and was having increased lumbar spine pain. The claimant reported her current pain rating as 0, best pain rating as 0, and worst pain rating as 10. The pain was located in the lumbar spine, described as discomfort and sharp. Sitting relieved the pain, while prolonged standing aggravated it. The pain had improved. 

Exam: The claimant demonstrated the following lumbar range of motion: flexion 55 degrees, extension 10 degrees, lateral flexion right 15 degrees, lateral flexion left 15 degrees. Strength testing revealed right hip flexion 5/5, right hip extension 3+/5, right hip abduction 3+/5, left hip flexion 5/5, left hip extension 3+/5, and left hip abduction 3/5. Left hip passive range of motion was internal rotation 25 degrees and external rotation 30 degrees. Repeated motion tests showed improved symptoms with flexion in standing and worsened symptoms with extension in standing. Special tests revealed positive straight leg raise on the left and positive slump test. Supine to long sit test was negative. Neurological examination showed normal light touch sensation, normal lower extremity myotomes (L1-S1), and normal patellar and ankle reflexes bilaterally. Palpation revealed tenderness to palpation over lumbar paraspinals and L3-L5 joint hypomobility. Posture assessment noted an increased lordotic curve in standing. The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) score was 35/80. Treatment diagnoses included right hip pain, left hip pain, and chronic bilateral low back pain with bilateral sciatica. Assessment revealed the following, Impairments was abnormal or restricted ROM, activity intolerance, impaired physical strength, lacks appropriate home exercise program, pain with function, weight-bearing intolerance, decreased ability to perform ADLs and impaired functional mobility. Claimant presented with Low back pain. She reported some difficulty with activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, including walking and standing. She presented in therapy with moderate core and hip strength deficits as well as decreased Lumbar ROM deficits. She presented with a flexion bias. Lumbar extension increases her lumbar spine pain and hip pain. She would benefit from a skilled physical therapy program to address these deficits to decrease pain and improve function.

Rehabilitation Potential: The claimant had a good prognosis. 

Plan: The treatment plan included planned modality interventions of thermotherapy using hydrocollator packs and cryotherapy. Planned therapy interventions included abdominal trunk stabilization, balance/weight bearing training, body mechanics training, functional ROM exercises, gait training, home exercise program, joint mobilization, manual therapy, neuromuscular re-education, postural training, soft tissue mobilization, spinal/joint mobilization, therapeutic exercise, therapeutic activities, stretching and strengthening. The plan was for the claimant to be seen 1-2 times per week for 6 weeks. The treatment plan was discussed with the claimant. Physical therapy services were to be rendered directly by the physical therapist with responsible utilization of physical therapist assistants. Short-term goals included: independence with an initial home exercise program, improving lumbar spine range of motion by 25%, improving hip strength to 4/5, and decreasing pain by 2 points on the VAS scale. Long-term goals included: independence with a comprehensive home exercise program, improving lumbar spine range of motion to full motion, improving hip strength to 4+/5, and decreasing pain to 0-2/10 with all ADLs. The claimant's stated goal was to get rid of the pain.

Right Spurling maneuver reproduced right upper extremity paresthesia. Upper extremity range of motion was full and painless. Palpation revealed focal tenderness in the right cervical paraspinals without associated spasm. No trigger points were found in the upper quarters. The right shoulder was non-tender throughout. Neurological examination showed no focal atrophy, fasciculations, or deformities. Manual muscle testing was normal (Grade 5/5) in the C5-T1 myotomes bilaterally. Reflexes were Grade 2/4 and symmetrical bilaterally at the biceps, brachioradialis, and triceps. Hoffmann reflex was negative, and with no ankle clonus. Sensation was intact to light touch in the upper extremity dermatomes bilaterally. Upper limb tension test was negative. Shoulder impingement signs were negative with no mid arc pain. Tinel's sign was negative over the carpal and cubital tunnels. The examiner noted that the claimant wore glasses. 

Conclusions: The evaluating physician concluded that the claimant sustained a concussion/post-concussion syndrome and cervical strain/sprain related to the 11/15/2019 motor vehicle accident. The claimant had not achieved maximum medical improvement nor fully recovered from the injuries sustained. She had persistent symptoms primarily associated with the cervical spine injury. Her prognosis for full recovery was guarded due to the duration of symptoms persisting despite treatment. The physician recommended further diagnostic testing including MRI of the cervical spine and electrodiagnostic testing of the right upper extremity. Depending on the results, the claimant may be a candidate for interventional therapies such as epidural steroid injection, diagnostic medial branch blockade, and/or radiofrequency neurotomy. The claimant continued to have physical limitations as a direct result of the accident, including limited tolerance for reading especially on video screens, limited tolerance for certain cervical spinal postures, and limited lifting tolerance of greater than 10lbs especially above shoulder level. 

Recommendations: The assessor recommended further diagnostic testing including an MRI of the cervical spine and electrodiagnostic testing (EMG/NCS studies) of the right upper extremity. Based on the results of these tests, the claimant may be a candidate for interventional therapies such as epidural steroid injection, diagnostic medial branch blockade, and/or radiofrequency neurotomy. The assessor noted that the claimant had not achieved maximum medical improvement and had not fully recovered from her injuries. Physical limitations were identified, including limited tolerance for reading especially on video screens, limited tolerance for certain cervical spinal postures, and limited lifting tolerance of greater than 10lbs especially above shoulder level. The assessor stated that these limitations were a direct result of the 11/15/2019 motor vehicle accident. "

She reported being able to tolerate more visual activity with less strain and headache. Fatigue, mental concentration, and word finding remained significant problems. When performing VTS-4 and SVI in vision therapy, she experienced discomfort that resolved shortly after, whereas initially she would have to lay down after getting home. The claimant changes in symptoms since last visit was found to be her right eye still felt off, which had been the case since the injury. Right eye pain had been improving overall, but if pain was going to happen, that's where it goes. Computer screen lights and bright sun bothered her. Headache frequency was improving. On 11/15/2019, she was a restrained driver in a vehicle collision where another vehicle pulled out of a parking lot in front of her. There was positive airbag deployment, and she believed she lost consciousness. The claimant was completed 21 sessions of vision therapy at concussion and head trauma, most sessions on 08/11/2020. She was tolerating and participating in sessions well, although session and activities can bring nausea and headache at times. 

Exam: The claimant was oriented to person, place, and time. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular motions were normal. The right and left pupils had regular shape, brisk reactivity, intact consensual response, and intact accommodation. There was no CN III palsy, CN VI palsy, nystagmus, diplopia, or ophthalmoparesis. Upgaze, downgaze, and conjugate gaze were normal. Visual acuities with glasses were 20/20 OD, 20/20 OS, and 20/20 OU at distance, and 20/30 OD, 20/20 OS, and 20/20 OU at near. Ishihara color vision testing was 7/7 OD and 7/7 OS. Randot stereopsis was 140 seconds of arc. Cover test showed comitant orthophoria at distance and 2 prism diopters of exophoria at near. Near point of convergence was 2 inches break and 3 inches recovery. Extraocular movements showed full range (5/5) with accurate horizontal and vertical saccades and no asymmetry or symptoms elicited. Refraction revealed a final prescription of +2.50 sphere OD and +2.50 -0.25 x090 OS with +2.25 add OU and 20/20 on VA-dist, VA- Near. PD was 59.0. The claimant was stable for prescription overall. Slight shift at distance.  Von Graefe testing showed 0 lateral and vertical phoria at distance, and 14 prism diopters exophoria at near. Vergence testing revealed distance divergence of 16/6, distance convergence of 18/12, near divergence of 28/16, and near convergence of 20/6 (blur/break/recovery). Accommodation testing showed NRA/PRA of +0.75/-1.00 and FCC of +2.00. 

Diagnoses: Binocular vision disorder with convergence insufficiency, Eye pain, right, Saccadic eye movement deficiency. 

Plan: The claimant was recommended to continue full-time glasses wear. In-office vision therapy was discontinued, and she was advised to return for re-evaluation in 3 months to ensure no regression. The practitioner recommended home vision therapy activities as prescribed, noting that the claimant had a brock string at home and would contact them if she had difficulty with home activities.

She was able to avoid a T-bone collision, but there was airbag deployment. The claimant believed she lost consciousness and recalled waking up with her head on the deflated airbag. Her chief complaints included right eye pain, light sensitivity, and persistent headaches. The claimant reported difficulty focusing her eyes, eye fatigue, discomfort, and strain. She experienced photophobia and pain above, around, and behind her right eye. The headaches were described as severe, daily, constant, and characterized by pounding, pressure, and throbbing. The claimant also complained of dizziness with position changes, feeling off balance, mental fogginess, and slowed cognitive processing. She reported difficulty focusing, concentrating, and remembering information. The claimant returned to work on 11/18/2019, but experienced an increase in symptoms. She was only able to use a stationary bike for 10 minutes due to increasing symptoms.

Exam: During the visit, the claimant's visual acuities were measured as 20/20-1 OD and OS for distance without correction, and 20/20 OU with correction. Near visual acuity was 20/20 OU with correction. Ishihara color vision testing showed 7/7 correct for both eyes. Randot stereopsis was 70 seconds of arc. Cover test revealed 2 prism diopters of esophoria at distance. Worth 4 Dot testing showed fusion at both distance and near. Near point of convergence was 3 inches break and 5 inches recovery. Extraocular motions were full and smooth in both eyes, with segmented vertical saccades noted. Visual midline was accurate. Refraction revealed mild changes in prescription. Accommodation testing showed NRA/PRA of +0.75/-1.00 and accommodative amplitude of +2.00 subjectively. Phorias measured with von Graefe method were 1 prism diopter left hyperphoria at distance and 12 prism diopters esophoria at near. Vergence ranges were measured. Intraocular pressures were 16 mmHg OD and 17 mmHg OS by Goldmann applanation tonometry. Slit lamp examination of the anterior segment was unremarkable. Dilated fundus examination showed normal optic nerves with 0.20 cup-to-disc ratio OU, normal maculae with foveal reflexes present, and normal vasculature and peripheral retina in both eyes.

Diagnoses: Eye pain, right, binocular vision disorder with convergence insufficiency, saccadic deficiency.

Plan: The practitioner recommended vision therapy to address the convergence insufficiency and saccadic deficiency. A change in spectacle prescription was suggested, with a mild change in total power for both eyes and a change in astigmatism for the right eye. These recommendations were made to address the visual deficits commonly seen following concussion, including convergence dysfunction and eye pain."

Right shoulder passive range of motion (PROMs) had improved from the last previous visit (LPV) and was full with no pain, only tightness. Other findings were grossly unchanged from the last visit. Spinal restrictions or subluxations were noted at the occiput, C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T1, T2, T4, T5, T6, T7, and T8 levels. Extraspinal restrictions or subluxations were identified at the left scapula, right scapula, and right shoulder. Pain and tenderness were present from the upper to mid cervical, mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, upper thoracic, and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis showed a forward flexed head and thoracic hyperkyphosis with rounded shoulders. Muscle spasms were rated 4 out of 10 in severity at the posterior head, left mid thoracic, left lower thoracic, anterior head, right posterior shoulder, right anterior shoulder, left trapezius, and left anterior trapezius tissue tone areas. Additional muscle spasms were rated 5 out of 10 at the right anterior trapezius, left side of the neck, right side of the neck, right posterior trapezius, right mid thoracic, and right lower thoracic tissue tone. Range of motion (ROM) concerns included moderately reduced cervical spine motion with moderate pain, moderately reduced thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation with mild to moderate pain, and mildly reduced right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation with mild tightness and stiffness. Neurological and mental status evaluations showed the patient was alert, oriented to person, place, and time, and cooperative. Neuro-sensory pain evaluations bilaterally showed normal dermatomal findings at all upper spinal segments. Gross touch and vibration sensations were within normal limits, as were light touch sensations at all tested areas. Upper extremity resistive isometric motor testing was normal (5/5) except for slight weakness (4+/5) on the left side in shoulder elevation, deltoid, and triceps muscles; the right side showed full strength (5/5) in these muscles. Deep tendon reflexes were normal (2+) overall, but slightly reduced at 1+ bilaterally in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis. Orthopedic tests showed Kemp's test bilaterally caused segmental pain rated 5 out of 10 at T2 through T7 without radiation. Distraction test relieved segmental and radiating pain on both sides, greater on the right at C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1. Maximum foramina compression test caused pain rated 6 out of 10 bilaterally, greater on the right at C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1 with radiation. Shoulder depression test caused pain rated 6 out of 10 bilaterally, greater on the right at the same cervical levels, with local pain radiating. Percussion with instrument caused pain in mid and upper thoracic regions. Costoclavicular maneuver showed no change in radial pulse bilaterally. Physical examination of the head, eyes, ears, and throat was unremarkable: normocephalic, atraumatic head, normal sclera, no conjunctival injection or pallor, no stare or lid lag, pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation (PERLA).

The claimant reported neck and upper shoulder pain described as ""on fire"" and tingling, with pain when turning her head, lifting things, reaching, cleaning, and sleeping. She experienced headaches, dizziness, balance issues, and vision problems in her right eye. She had difficulty returning to work due to driving and laptop use requirements. The claimant attempted to resume exercise but became nauseated. On 01/29/2020, she reported her balance seemed better but any physical activity continued to bother her. She experienced constant burning pain down her right arm to her hand, worsening with physical activities and movement. The claimant also reported constant low-level pain and burning down the outside and dorsal forearm to the wrist on the right side. 

Exam: The claimant presented with height 5'8"", weight 155 lbs. Grip strength was 50 lbs right and 54 lbs left. The neuro-mental status evaluations were performed, and the claimant was observed to be alert, oriented to person, place, and time (X3), and cooperative. Neuro-sensory and pain assessments were conducted bilaterally, revealing normal dermatomal findings at all upper spinal segments. Gross touch and vibration sensations were evaluated and found to be within normal limits at all upper spinal segments. Light touch sensations were also assessed and noted to be within normal limits throughout the upper spinal segments. Upper extremity resistive isometric motor testing showed slight weakness on the left side with shoulder elevation and deltoid graded at 4+/5, and triceps at 4+/5, while all other tested muscles, including biceps bilaterally, were normal at 5/5. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished bilaterally with biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis reflexes all graded 1+. Orthopedic testing included bilateral Kemp’s test, which elicited segmental pain rated 6 out of 10 at T2 through T7 without radiation. The distraction test produced no pain bilaterally. Maximum foraminal compression tests caused pain rated 8 out of 10 on both sides, greater on the left, at cervical levels C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1, with radiation noted. Shoulder depression testing did not increase pain, while percussion over the mid and upper thoracic spine elicited tenderness. The costoclavicular maneuver showed no change in radial pulse bilaterally. Spinal restrictions and subluxations were identified at the occiput, C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T1, T2, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, right T10, and right T11. Extraspinal restrictions were found at the left and right scapulae and the right shoulder. Tenderness and pain were present from the upper to mid cervical, mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, and upper to mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis revealed a forward-flexed head and thoracic hyperkyphosis. Muscle spasms were documented with a severity of 4 out of 10 in the left anterior shoulder, posterior head, left posterior shoulder, left triceps, and left mid and lower thoracic tissues. Additional muscle spasms rated 6 out of 10 were noted in the anterior head, bilateral anterior trapezius (right greater than left), right anterior shoulder, posterior head, bilateral sides of the neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right mid and lower thoracic, and right lumbar tissues. Range of motion was moderately reduced with pain throughout the cervical spine, thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation, while right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation were mildly reduced with pain. Physical examination of the head, eyes, ears, and throat showed a normocephalic, atraumatic head with normal sclera and no conjunctival injection or pallor. There was no stare or lid lag, and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation (PERLA). The skin over the entire body, including arms, legs, trunk, and head/neck, appeared grossly normal, dry, and warm, without diaphoresis, depigmentation, hyperpigmentation, rashes, ulcers, ecchymosis, purple striae, excessive hair, or acne. Palpation of lymph nodes in the neck, bilateral axilla, groin, and other areas revealed no tenderness, swelling, or enlargement, with grossly normal findings overall. Claimant tolerated cervical spine passive range of motion stretching pretty well, with little upper extremities referral or spasming noted. Primary hot spots ID'd with both palpation and with the Laser stimulation device, were at the right lower CS along C6-7 facets and psm, and at C4-5 facets laterally. Other Findings were grossly unchanged from the last visit.  Treatment diagnosis included Strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level; Other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 levels; Other muscle spasm; Car occupant injured in other specified transport accidents; Muscle spasm of back; Other specified dorsopathies, thoracic region; Concussion without loss of consciousness; Pain in right shoulder; Segmental and somatic dysfunction of upper extremity.

HPI: The claimant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11/15/2019. She was the driver of a Ford Explorer SUV when another vehicle pulled into her path, causing her to swerve into oncoming traffic and hit the other vehicle at an angle. An airbag deployed, hitting her face and lacerating her eyebrow. She was knocked unconscious for an unknown duration. Following the accident, the claimant experienced headaches, dizziness, vision issues in her right eye, neck pain, and upper shoulder pain described as ""on fire"" and tingling. She reported difficulty turning her head, lifting things, reaching, cleaning, and sleeping. The claimant attempted to return to work the Monday after the accident but struggled due to driving and laptop use requirements. As of 01/27/2020, claimant t stated that during physical therapy, she had been doing light bike riding and walking, but even these activities caused her to feel like her balance was off. She did not see much improvement with this issue but believed that coming to therapy was preventing it from getting worse. She reported that any physical activity bothered her and that there was never a time when she was not experiencing pain or burning. She reported functional deficits in caring for family, concentrating, driving, exercising, household chores, lifting, looking over shoulder, reaching overhead, sleeping, and computer use. 

Exam: The neuro-mental status evaluations were performed, and the claimant was observed to be alert, oriented to person, place, and time (X3), and cooperative. Neuro-sensory and pain assessments were conducted bilaterally, revealing normal dermatomal findings at all upper spinal segments. Gross touch and vibration sensations were evaluated and found to be within normal limits at all upper spinal segments. Light touch sensations were also assessed and noted to be within normal limits throughout the upper spinal segments. Upper extremity resistive isometric motor testing showed slight weakness on the left side with shoulder elevation and deltoid graded at 4+/5, and triceps at 4+/5, while all other tested muscles, including biceps bilaterally, were normal at 5/5. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished bilaterally with biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis reflexes all graded 1+. Orthopedic testing included bilateral Kemp’s test, which elicited segmental pain rated 6 out of 10 at T2 through T7 without radiation. The distraction test produced no pain bilaterally. Maximum foraminal compression tests caused pain rated 8 out of 10 on both sides, greater on the left, at cervical levels C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1, with radiation noted. Shoulder depression testing did not increase pain, while percussion over the mid and upper thoracic spine elicited tenderness. The costoclavicular maneuver showed no change in radial pulse bilaterally. Spinal restrictions and subluxations were identified at the occiput, C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T1, T2, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, right T10, and right T11. Extraspinal restrictions were found at the left and right scapulae and the right shoulder. Tenderness and pain were present from the upper to mid cervical, mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, and upper to mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis revealed a forward-flexed head and thoracic hyperkyphosis. Muscle spasms were documented with a severity of 4 out of 10 in the left anterior shoulder, posterior head, left posterior shoulder, left triceps, and left mid and lower thoracic tissues. Additional muscle spasms rated 6 out of 10 were noted in the anterior head, bilateral anterior trapezius (right greater than left), right anterior shoulder, posterior head, bilateral sides of the neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right mid and lower thoracic, and right lumbar tissues. Range of motion was moderately reduced with pain throughout the cervical spine, thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation, while right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation were mildly reduced with pain. Physical examination of the head, eyes, ears, and throat showed a normocephalic, atraumatic head with normal sclera and no conjunctival injection or pallor. There was no stare or lid lag, and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation (PERLA). The skin over the entire body, including arms, legs, trunk, and head/neck, appeared grossly normal, dry, and warm, without diaphoresis, depigmentation, hyperpigmentation, rashes, ulcers, ecchymosis, purple striae, excessive hair, or acne. Palpation of lymph nodes in the neck, bilateral axilla, groin, and other areas revealed no tenderness, swelling, or enlargement, with grossly normal findings overall. The Neck Disability Index score was 60%. Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale average was 6.0, ranging from 4/10 to 7/10. Treatment diagnoses included strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5,  other cervical disc degeneration at C5-C6, and  other cervical disc degeneration at C6-C7 levels, other muscle spasm, muscle spasm of back, other specified dorsopathies of thoracic region, concussion without loss of consciousness, pain in right shoulder, and segmental and somatic dysfunction of upper extremity, car occupant (driver) (passenger) injured in other specified transport accidents.  

Rehabilitation Potential: Claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals. 

Plan: The treatment plan consisted of a 45-minute massage therapy session performed by a licensed massage therapist using effleurage, petrissage, tapotement, and pincement techniques targeting the anterior head, right and left anterior trapezius, left anterior shoulder, posterior head, left and right sides of the neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, and left posterior shoulder. Ultrasound therapy was applied for 8 minutes with continuous 100% settings at 1.2 W/cm² using a contact medium on the left and right sides of the neck and the upper thoracic region. A moist hot pack was applied to the posterior cervical (neck) region for 10 minutes. Mechanical traction was performed for 10 minutes on the mid to lower cervical spine using Y-Axis traction with 9 lbs of force at 20 degrees of flexion. Passive and active stretching exercises lasting 10 minutes were conducted focusing on cervical spine range of motion, Levator Scapulae (including SO), Upper Trapezius, Scalenes, Splenii, and scapulothoracic mobilizations. Joint manipulation techniques, including mobilization and gentle thrust motions to patient tolerance, were applied to extremity joints as identified in objective findings, particularly the right shoulder. Chiropractic manipulation using low force techniques such as Activator and Drops was performed on all regions based on clinical findings. The treatment was rendered without incident, and the patient is responding as expected. The claimant was advised to return as soon as possible for the next visit. Long-term goal was to attain pre-condition/pre-injury status. Treatment effectiveness would be evaluated using functional outcome assessment tools including Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale Questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and Neck Pain Disability Index Questionnaire, with a goal score of 10% or better improvement.

The spinal examination revealed restrictions and subluxations at the occiput, C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, and T8 levels. Extraspinal restrictions were identified in the left and right scapulae. The patient experienced pain and tenderness in the upper to mid cervical region, mid to lower cervical area, cervico-thoracic junction, upper thoracic, and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis showed a forward-flexed head and thoracic hyperkyphosis. Muscle spasms were noted as hypertonic in the right anterior trapezius, left anterior trapezius, posterior head, left and right sides of the neck, left and right trapezius, left and right posterior shoulders, left and right mid thoracic, and left and right lower thoracic tissue tone. Range of motion assessment indicated that the entire cervical spine was moderately reduced, with pain reported during movement. Physical examination of the head, eyes, ears, and throat showed a normocephalic, atraumatic head with normal sclera and no conjunctival injection or pallor. There was no stare or lid lag, and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation (PERLA). The skin over the entire body, including arms, legs, trunk, and head/neck, appeared grossly normal, dry, and warm, without diaphoresis, depigmentation, hyperpigmentation, rashes, ulcers, ecchymosis, purple striae, excessive hair, or acne. Palpation of lymph nodes in the neck, bilateral axilla, groin, and other areas revealed no tenderness, swelling, or enlargement, with grossly normal findings overall. Treatment diagnoses included strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5,  other cervical disc degeneration at C5-C6, and  other cervical disc degeneration at C6-C7 levels, other muscle spasm, muscle spasm of back, other specified dorsopathies of thoracic region, concussion without loss of consciousness, pain in right shoulder, and segmental and somatic dysfunction of upper extremity, car occupant (driver) (passenger) injured in other specified transport accidents.

She was the driver of a Ford Explorer SUV when another vehicle pulled into her path, causing her to swerve and collide at an angle. An airbag deployed, hitting her face and lacerating her eyebrow. She lost consciousness for an unknown duration. Following the accident, she experienced headaches, vision issues in her right eye, neck and upper shoulder pain described as ""on fire"" and tingling, with difficulty turning her head, lifting, reaching, cleaning, and sleeping. She reported constant headaches on top of her head and behind the right eye, described as ""pounding"". The claimant noted balance problems, dizziness, nausea with exercise, and difficulty concentrating. She experienced burning pain down her right arm to her hand, worsening with physical activities. She reported sleep disturbances due to discomfort. The claimant struggled to return to work, which involved driving and laptop use. She rated her pain as 7/10. By 02/05/2020, she reported improvements over the weekend and during the week. However, her right arm felt like it was on fire, with tingling and numbness. She believed this might have been caused by irritation from the way she was lying during her massage that day. During the last visit with the use of the laser, she reported seeing a lot of improvement. The patient noted improvements in headache intensity and frequency, as well as in her eye convergence, which was becoming easier and faster for her.

Exam: Spinal restrictions and subluxations were identified at the occiput, C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T1, T2, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, right T10, and right T11. Extraspinal restrictions were found at the left and right scapulae and the right shoulder. Tenderness and pain were present from the upper to mid cervical, mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, and upper to mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis revealed a forward-flexed head and thoracic hyperkyphosis. Muscle spasms were documented with a severity of 4 out of 10 in the left anterior shoulder, posterior head, left posterior shoulder, left triceps, and left mid and lower thoracic tissues. Additional muscle spasms rated 6 out of 10 were noted in the anterior head, bilateral anterior trapezius (right greater than left), right anterior shoulder, posterior head, bilateral sides of the neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right mid and lower thoracic, and right lumbar tissues. Range of motion was moderately reduced with pain throughout the cervical spine, thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation, while right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation were mildly reduced with pain. The neuro-mental status evaluations were performed, and the patient was observed to be alert, oriented to person, place, and time (X3), and cooperative. Neuro-sensory and pain assessments were conducted bilaterally, revealing normal dermatomal findings at all upper spinal segments. Gross touch and vibration sensations were evaluated and found to be within normal limits at all upper spinal segments. Light touch sensations were also assessed and noted to be within normal limits throughout the upper spinal segments. Upper extremity resistive isometric motor testing showed slight weakness on the left side with shoulder elevation and deltoid graded at 4+/5, and triceps at 4+/5, while all other tested muscles, including biceps bilaterally, were normal at 5/5. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished bilaterally with biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis reflexes all graded 1+. Orthopedic testing included bilateral Kemp’s test, which elicited segmental pain rated 6 out of 10 at T2 through T7 without radiation. The distraction test produced no pain bilaterally. Maximum foraminal compression tests caused pain rated 8 out of 10 on both sides, greater on the left, at cervical levels C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1, with radiation noted. Shoulder depression testing did not increase pain, while percussion over the mid and upper thoracic spine elicited tenderness. The costoclavicular maneuver showed no change in radial pulse bilaterally. Physical examination of the head, eyes, ears, and throat showed a normocephalic, atraumatic head with normal sclera and no conjunctival injection or pallor. There was no stare or lid lag, and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation (PERLA). The skin over the entire body, including arms, legs, trunk, and head/neck, appeared grossly normal, dry, and warm, without diaphoresis, depigmentation, hyperpigmentation, rashes, ulcers, ecchymosis, purple striae, excessive hair, or acne. Palpation of lymph nodes in the neck, bilateral axilla, groin, and other areas revealed no tenderness, swelling, or enlargement, with grossly normal findings overall. Treatment diagnoses included strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5,  other cervical disc degeneration at C5-C6, and  other cervical disc degeneration at C6-C7 levels, other muscle spasm, muscle spasm of back, other specified dorsopathies of thoracic region, concussion without loss of consciousness, pain in right shoulder, and segmental and somatic dysfunction of upper extremity, car occupant (driver) (passenger) injured in other specified transport accidents. 

Rehabilitation Potential: Modest improvement as indicated in visit day's subjective and objective evaluations.

Plan: Treatment plan included therapeutic massage was performed using effleurage, petrissage, tapotement, and pincement techniques on the anterior head (right), anterior trapezius (left and right), anterior shoulder (left), posterior head, left and right sides of the neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, and left posterior shoulder for 45 minutes. A hot moist pack was applied to the posterior cervical (neck) region for 10 minutes. Y-axis mechanical traction was applied to the mid to lower cervical spine for 10 minutes using 9 lbs of force at 20 degrees of flexion. Passive and active stretching were performed for 10 minutes targeting cervical spine range of motion (ROM), including levator scapulae, upper trapezius, scalenes, splenius muscles, and scapulothoracic mobilizations. Manipulation of the right shoulder extremity joint was performed using mobilization techniques and gentle thrust motions to patient tolerance. Chiropractic manipulation was performed on all regions as per clinical findings using low force techniques (Activator and Drops) to the mid and upper thoracic spine, which produced some cavitation. The treatment was rendered without incident and the claimant was responding as expected. The claimant was advised to return as soon as possible for the next visit. The short-term goal was to increase the claimant's ability to perform daily activities within 42 days unless improvement warrants discharge sooner. The long-term goal was to attain pre-condition/pre-injury status. Treatment effectiveness will be evaluated using functional outcome assessment tools including the Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale Questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and Neck Pain Disability Index Questionnaire, with a goal score of 10% or better.

The costoclavicular maneuver showed no change in radial pulse bilaterally. The examination revealed spinal restrictions and subluxations at the occiput, C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, and T8. Extraspinal restrictions and subluxations were identified in the left scapula, right scapula, and right shoulder. The patient reported pain and tenderness in the upper to mid cervical region, mid to lower cervical area, cervico-thoracic junction, upper thoracic, and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis showed a forward flexed head and thoracic hyperkyphosis. Muscle spasms were noted with a severity of 4 out of 10 in the posterior head, left posterior shoulder, left mid thoracic, and left lower thoracic tissue tone. Additionally, muscle spasms rated 6 out of 10 were observed in the right anterior trapezius, left anterior trapezius, left and right sides of the neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right mid thoracic, and right lower thoracic tissue tone. Range of motion concerns included a moderately reduced and painful entire cervical spine, moderately reduced and painful thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation, as well as mildly reduced and painful right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation. Physical examination of the head, eyes, ears, and throat showed a normocephalic, atraumatic head with normal sclera and no conjunctival injection or pallor. There was no stare or lid lag, and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation (PERLA). The skin over the entire body, including arms, legs, trunk, and head/neck, appeared grossly normal, dry, and warm, without diaphoresis, depigmentation, hyperpigmentation, rashes, ulcers, ecchymosis, purple striae, excessive hair, or acne. Palpation of lymph nodes in the neck, bilateral axilla, groin, and other areas revealed no tenderness, swelling, or enlargement, with grossly normal findings overall. Treatment diagnoses included strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5,  other cervical disc degeneration at C5-C6, and  other cervical disc degeneration at C6-C7 levels, other muscle spasm, muscle spasm of back, other specified dorsopathies of thoracic region, concussion without loss of consciousness, pain in right shoulder, and segmental and somatic dysfunction of upper extremity, car occupant (driver) (passenger) injured in other specified transport accidents.

The claimant attempted to return to work the Monday after the accident but struggled due to driving and laptop use requirements. As of 01/27/2020, claimant t stated that during physical therapy, she had been doing light bike riding and walking, but even these activities caused her to feel like her balance was off. She did not see much improvement with this issue but believed that coming to therapy was preventing it from getting worse. She reported that any physical activity bothered her and that there was never a time when she was not experiencing pain or burning. She reported functional deficits in caring for family, concentrating, driving, exercising, household chores, lifting, looking over shoulder, reaching overhead, sleeping, and computer use. 

Exam: The neuro-mental status evaluations were performed, and the claimant was observed to be alert, oriented to person, place, and time (X3), and cooperative. Neuro-sensory and pain assessments were conducted bilaterally, revealing normal dermatomal findings at all upper spinal segments. Gross touch and vibration sensations were evaluated and found to be within normal limits at all upper spinal segments. Light touch sensations were also assessed and noted to be within normal limits throughout the upper spinal segments. Upper extremity resistive isometric motor testing showed slight weakness on the left side with shoulder elevation and deltoid graded at 4+/5, and triceps at 4+/5, while all other tested muscles, including biceps bilaterally, were normal at 5/5. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished bilaterally with biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis reflexes all graded 1+. Orthopedic testing included bilateral Kemp’s test, which elicited segmental pain rated 6 out of 10 at T2 through T7 without radiation. The distraction test produced no pain bilaterally. Maximum foraminal compression tests caused pain rated 8 out of 10 on both sides, greater on the left, at cervical levels C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1, with radiation noted. Shoulder depression testing did not increase pain, while percussion over the mid and upper thoracic spine elicited tenderness. The costoclavicular maneuver showed no change in radial pulse bilaterally. Spinal restrictions and subluxations were identified at the occiput, C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T1, T2, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, right T10, and right T11. Extraspinal restrictions were found at the left and right scapulae and the right shoulder. Tenderness and pain were present from the upper to mid cervical, mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, and upper to mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis revealed a forward-flexed head and thoracic hyperkyphosis. Muscle spasms were documented with a severity of 4 out of 10 in the left anterior shoulder, posterior head, left posterior shoulder, left triceps, and left mid and lower thoracic tissues. Additional muscle spasms rated 6 out of 10 were noted in the anterior head, bilateral anterior trapezius (right greater than left), right anterior shoulder, posterior head, bilateral sides of the neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right mid and lower thoracic, and right lumbar tissues. Range of motion was moderately reduced with pain throughout the cervical spine, thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation, while right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation were mildly reduced with pain. Physical examination of the head, eyes, ears, and throat showed a normocephalic, atraumatic head with normal sclera and no conjunctival injection or pallor. There was no stare or lid lag, and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation (PERLA). The skin over the entire body, including arms, legs, trunk, and head/neck, appeared grossly normal, dry, and warm, without diaphoresis, depigmentation, hyperpigmentation, rashes, ulcers, ecchymosis, purple striae, excessive hair, or acne. Palpation of lymph nodes in the neck, bilateral axilla, groin, and other areas revealed no tenderness, swelling, or enlargement, with grossly normal findings overall. The Neck Disability Index score was 60%. Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale average was 6.0, ranging from 4/10 to 7/10. Treatment diagnoses included strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5,  other cervical disc degeneration at C5-C6, and  other cervical disc degeneration at C6-C7 levels, other muscle spasm, muscle spasm of back, other specified dorsopathies of thoracic region, concussion without loss of consciousness, pain in right shoulder, and segmental and somatic dysfunction of upper extremity, car occupant (driver) (passenger) injured in other specified transport accidents.  

Rehabilitation Potential: Claimant was of fair health and was expected to make fair progress and recovery with some residuals.  

Plan: The treatment plan consisted of a 45-minute massage therapy session performed by a licensed massage therapist using effleurage, petrissage, tapotement, and pincement techniques targeting the anterior head, right and left anterior trapezius, left anterior shoulder, posterior head, left and right sides of the neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, and left posterior shoulder. Ultrasound therapy was applied for 8 minutes with continuous 100% settings at 1.2 W/cm² using a contact medium on the left and right sides of the neck and the upper thoracic region. A moist hot pack was applied to the posterior cervical (neck) region for 10 minutes. Mechanical traction was performed for 10 minutes on the mid to lower cervical spine using Y-Axis traction with 9 lbs of force at 20 degrees of flexion. Passive and active stretching exercises lasting 10 minutes were conducted focusing on cervical spine range of motion, Levator Scapulae (including SO), Upper Trapezius, Scalenes, Splenii, and scapulothoracic mobilizations. Joint manipulation techniques, including mobilization and gentle thrust motions to patient tolerance, were applied to extremity joints as identified in objective findings, particularly the right shoulder. Chiropractic manipulation using low force techniques such as Activator and Drops was performed on all regions based on clinical findings. The treatment was rendered without incident, and the patient is responding as expected. The claimant was advised to return as soon as possible for the next visit. Long-term goal was to attain pre-condition/pre-injury status. Treatment effectiveness would be evaluated using functional outcome assessment tools including Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale Questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and Neck Pain Disability Index Questionnaire, with a goal score of 10% or better improvement.

She experienced tingling in the right arm but it was not burning like before. Her right shoulder had pain. She had minimal symptoms on her left side. The claimant stated her discomfort level at its worst was rated 5/10. She reported improvements in headache intensity and frequency, as well as in her eye convergence. She reported difficulty with caring for family, concentrating, driving, exercising, getting to sleep, performing household chores, lifting objects, looking over shoulder, reaching overhead, staying asleep, and using a computer for more than 15 minutes. On 02/10/2020. The claimant reported significantly less pain, primarily in the right medial and upper scapular region, following recent treatments. She tried a different pillow, which caused neck discomfort this morning. She experienced tingling in the right arm, though it was no longer burning as it was previously. The right shoulder remains painful. She had minimal symptoms on the left side. The claimant continued with physical therapy and vision therapy twice a week.

Exam: Examination revealed the neuro-mental status evaluations were performed, and the claimant was observed to be alert, oriented to person, place, and time (X3), and cooperative. Neuro-sensory and pain assessments were conducted bilaterally, revealing normal dermatomal findings at all upper spinal segments. Gross touch and vibration sensations were evaluated and found to be within normal limits at all upper spinal segments. Light touch sensations were also assessed and noted to be within normal limits throughout the upper spinal segments. Upper extremity resistive isometric motor testing showed slight weakness on the left side with shoulder elevation and deltoid graded at 4+/5, and triceps at 4+/5, while all other tested muscles, including biceps bilaterally, were normal at 5/5. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished bilaterally with biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis reflexes all graded 1+. Orthopedic testing included bilateral Kemp’s test, which elicited segmental pain rated 6 out of 10 at T2 through T7 without radiation. The distraction test produced no pain bilaterally. Maximum foraminal compression tests caused pain rated 8 out of 10 on both sides, greater on the left, at cervical levels C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1, with radiation noted. Shoulder depression testing did not increase pain, while percussion over the mid and upper thoracic spine elicited tenderness. The costoclavicular maneuver showed no change in radial pulse bilaterally. The examination revealed spinal restrictions and subluxations at the occiput, C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T1, T2, T4, T5, T6, T7, and T8 levels. Extraspinal restrictions and subluxations were noted in the left scapula, right scapula, and right shoulder. Pain and tenderness were present in the upper to mid cervical, mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, upper thoracic, and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis showed a forward-flexed head and thoracic hyperkyphosis. Muscle spasms were graded at 4 out of 10 in the anterior head, posterior head, left mid thoracic, and left lower thoracic tissues, and at 6 out of 10 in the right anterior trapezius, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, left and right sides of the neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right mid thoracic, right lower thoracic, and right lumbar tissues. Range of motion concerns included a moderately reduced cervical spine motion with mild to moderate pain, moderately reduced thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation with mild to moderate pain, and mildly reduced right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation accompanied by mild tightness and pain. Physical examination of the head, eyes, ears, and throat showed a normocephalic, atraumatic head with normal sclera and no conjunctival injection or pallor. There was no stare or lid lag, and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation (PERLA). The skin over the entire body, including arms, legs, trunk, and head/neck, appeared grossly normal, dry, and warm, without diaphoresis, depigmentation, hyperpigmentation, rashes, ulcers, ecchymosis, purple striae, excessive hair, or acne. Palpation of lymph nodes in the neck, bilateral axilla, groin, and other areas revealed no tenderness, swelling, or enlargement, with grossly normal findings overall.  Treatment diagnoses included strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5,  other cervical disc degeneration at C5-C6, and  other cervical disc degeneration at C6-C7 levels, other muscle spasm, muscle spasm of back, other specified dorsopathies of thoracic region, concussion without loss of consciousness, pain in right shoulder, and segmental and somatic dysfunction of upper extremity, car occupant (driver) (passenger) injured in other specified transport accidents.

The examination revealed spinal restrictions and subluxations at the occiput, C1, C2, C5, C6, C7, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, and T8. Extraspinal restrictions and subluxations were identified in the left scapula, right scapula, and right shoulder. The patient reported pain and tenderness in the upper to mid cervical region, mid to lower cervical area, cervico-thoracic junction, upper thoracic, and mid-thoracic regions. Postural analysis showed a forward flexed head and thoracic hyperkyphosis. Muscle spasms were noted with a severity of 4 out of 10 in the posterior head, left posterior shoulder, left mid thoracic, and left lower thoracic tissue tone. Additionally, muscle spasms rated 6 out of 10 were observed in the right anterior trapezius, left anterior trapezius, left and right sides of the neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, right posterior shoulder, right mid thoracic, and right lower thoracic tissue tone. Range of motion concerns included a moderately reduced and painful entire cervical spine, moderately reduced and painful thoracic flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation, as well as mildly reduced and painful right shoulder abduction, flexion, and internal rotation. Physical examination of the head, eyes, ears, and throat showed a normocephalic, atraumatic head with normal sclera and no conjunctival injection or pallor. There was no stare or lid lag, and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation (PERLA). The skin over the entire body, including arms, legs, trunk, and head/neck, appeared grossly normal, dry, and warm, without diaphoresis, depigmentation, hyperpigmentation, rashes, ulcers, ecchymosis, purple striae, excessive hair, or acne. Palpation of lymph nodes in the neck, bilateral axilla, groin, and other areas revealed no tenderness, swelling, or enlargement, with grossly normal findings overall. Treatment diagnoses included strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, other cervical disc degeneration at C4-C5,  other cervical disc degeneration at C5-C6, and  other cervical disc degeneration at C6-C7 levels, other muscle spasm, muscle spasm of back, other specified dorsopathies of thoracic region, concussion without loss of consciousness, pain in right shoulder, and segmental and somatic dysfunction of upper extremity, car occupant (driver) (passenger) injured in other specified transport accidents. 

Rehabilitation Potential: Same and meeting expectations as indicated in visit day's subjective and objective evaluations.

Plan: Therapeutic massage, including effleurage, petrissage, tapotement, and pincement techniques, was performed on the following muscle groups: right anterior trapezius, left anterior trapezius, right anterior shoulder, left anterior shoulder, posterior head, left side of neck, right side of neck, left trapezius, right posterior trapezius, left posterior shoulder, right posterior shoulder, left mid thoracic, and right mid thoracic for 45 minutes by a licensed massage therapist. The treatment was rendered without incident, and the patient responded as expected. The plan was to continue with the treatment as scheduled, with the patient following up for care on Wednesday. The short-term goal was to increase the claimant's ability to perform daily activities that have become difficult due to the injury by the re-exam date within 42 days. The long-term goal was to attain pre-condition/pre-injury status. Treatment effectiveness will be evaluated using functional outcome assessment tools including the Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale Questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and Neck Pain Disability Index Questionnaire, with a goal score of 10% or better improvement.
